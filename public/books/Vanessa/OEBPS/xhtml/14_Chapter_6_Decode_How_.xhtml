			<p class="x03-CO-Body-Text"><span class="_idGenDropcap-1">I </span>have a sad story to tell you—but don’t worry, it has a happy ending.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">In the 1970s, there was a forty-two-year-old housewife who was having a midlife crisis. To protect her identity, we will call her Mary. Upon reaching her fortieth birthday, Mary found herself alone most of the time. Her children had grown and moved out of the house, and her husband was a busy professional. At night she had difficulty sleeping, and during the day she had a harder and harder time managing the house. Frequently, she spent most of the day crying. She complained of feeling overwhelmingly “useless.” Finally, she began to contemplate suicide.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Luckily, Mary knew she needed help. Her family admitted her to a local hospital for extra care. The first three weeks of treatment went well—a combination of group therapy and medication seemed successful. During one of Mary’s filmed sessions with her psychiatrist, Mary insisted she was feeling significantly better. Given her improved mood, Mary asked, perhaps she could get a weekend pass to visit her family? After consulting with the staff, the doctor agreed with the team: Mary was better.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Fortunately, right before checking out, Mary came clean. She went to her doctor and admitted that she had been lying in her interview and faking it in group therapy sessions. She was still desperately depressed. The coming weekend, she’d planned to do something drastic away from the hospital. But her confession marked a true turning point in her recovery, and after many months of treatment—overcoming a few relapses—Mary went on to lead a normal life with her family.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Despite this happy ending, the Mary incident left the hospital’s <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_104" title="104"/>medical team rattled. <strong>How had she deceived so many people in the facility?</strong> The hospital staff reviewed a video recording of the doctor’s interview with Mary—what had they missed? In fact, medical deception is a worrying dilemma—patients frequently lie to their doctors, and psychologists dread being fooled by patients who hide their real health needs.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">After multiple experienced psychologists reviewed Mary’s film without answers, the team decided to get more help. They enlisted Dr. Paul Ekman, a young psychologist who had been conducting experiments on human lie detection with patients.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber52" id="SuperscriptNumber52"><sup class="endnote">1</sup></a></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Dr. Ekman and his team spent hundreds of hours reviewing Mary’s footage. It wasn’t until he put the video in slow motion that clues began to emerge. When the doctor asked Mary about her plans for the weekend, a frightening emotion leaked out. You just had to know where to look.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“We saw in slow-motion a fleeting facial expression of despair, so quick that we had missed seeing it the first few times we examined the film,” explained Dr. Ekman.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber53" id="SuperscriptNumber53"><sup class="endnote">2</sup></a></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">This flicker of sorrow was the break that Ekman and his team needed. They began to re-examine the footage looking for these microgestures. After a few rounds, they started spotting them consistently—always right before a lie, and often covered by a fake smile. Dr. Ekman came to call these flickering facial gestures “microexpressions.”</p>

			<h3 class="x05-Head-A">FACE SCIENCE</h3>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Doctors once thought babies learned to smile by mimicking the doting expressions of their mothers and fathers. This is a myth.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Congenitally blind babies make the same facial expressions as other babies—despite having never seen a face.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber54" id="SuperscriptNumber54"><sup class="endnote">3</sup></a> Our instinct to make certain expressions derives from nature, not nurture.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber55" id="SuperscriptNumber55"><sup class="endnote">4</sup></a> <strong>Microexpressions are an innate universal human behavior.</strong></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Fascinated by this idea, Dr. Paul Ekman conducted a series of studies in a remote part of New Guinea.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber56" id="SuperscriptNumber56"><sup class="endnote">5</sup></a> He brought with him photos of Americans expressing different emotions—showing everything from <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_105" title="105"/>smiles to grimaces to frowns. The tribe he was visiting was especially disconnected from the Western world. They’d never seen a movie, much less a TV.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">With a translator’s help, Dr. Ekman asked the New Guineans to examine the Americans’ facial expressions and guess what they thought each American was feeling in the picture. Dr. Ekman was shocked to find that their guesses were extremely accurate.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber57" id="SuperscriptNumber57"><sup class="endnote">6</sup></a> They could even perform the experiment in reverse. As Ekman named an emotion, participants quickly mimed the corresponding facial expression.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">After repeating this experiment with participants all around the world, Dr. Ekman was able to identify seven universal microexpressions.</p>
			<p class="x06-Extract-1P"><strong>Microexpression:</strong> <em>n. </em>A brief, involuntary facial expression that humans make when they feel an intense emotion.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">We make these expressions regardless of culture, sex, or race. This is why reading microexpressions is such a valuable people hack. <strong>Since everyone falls prey to the same seven facial tells, we can study them, spot them, and decode them.</strong></p>
			<h3 class="x05-Head-A">HOW TO DECODE FACES</h3>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">While my husband watches <em>Monday Night Football</em> on ESPN, I am glued to ABC for my weekly Monday dose of <em>The Bachelorette</em>. It’s trashy TV that I insist is “for work” to “observe human behavior.” Really, I just want to win my Bachelorette Fantasy League.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">In one particularly notable season, bachelorette Emily Maynard meets Arie Luyendyk Jr., a dreamy race car driver from Arizona. There are twenty-five men competing to win Emily’s heart and propose to her at the end of the season. Tall with a big smile and blue eyes, Arie has potential to go all the way. There is only one problem. Emily’s former fiancé was also a race car driver and tragically died on the way to a race. Could Arie’s profession hit too close to home? Let me tell you, viewers like me were on the edge of our seats to find out.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The night of the confession, Arie sits Emily down to “tell her something.” Emily smiles demurely, waiting for the potential bomb to drop. Here’s a recap of just the verbal exchange:</p>

			<p class="x04-Body-Text">During this interaction, Emily showed three crucial microexpressions: sadness, fear, and contempt. These were key because they were <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_107" title="107"/>incongruent with her words. Even though her words said she was fine, her true emotions were displayed on her face.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Emily didn’t choose Arie in the end. He made it to the final two before being cut. Anyone who could read microexpressions would not have been surprised by Arie’s fate. His profession was a deal breaker. All you had to do was look at her face to see it—perhaps this could have saved Arie. If he had noticed her hidden emotions and addressed them, he could have reassured her. Instead, he missed the nonverbal clues of what was to come.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">I call this hack “The Decoder”:</p>
			<p class="x06-Extract-A-First">HACK #6: The Decoder</p>
			<p class="x06-Extract-A-Last">Spot the seven microexpressions during interactions to uncover truth.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Decoding is all about looking for the emotional intent behind the words. It’s about listening by hearing <em>and</em> looking.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">First, here’s how to use the Decoder hack:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-First"><strong>Congruency</strong>: Look to see if someone’s stated emotions match their visible emotions. If your client says he is happy to see you, he should have a happy microexpression. If your wife says she is “fine,” but has an angry microexpression, she probably isn’t “fine.”</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted"><strong>Connection:</strong> People make microexpressions while they are talking <em>and</em> while they are listening. Facial expressiveness is never “off.” While this can be a lot to take in, paying consistent attention to someone’s face also helps you with Hack #2—the eye contact piece of the Triple Threat. If you thought your average eye contact was below 60 percent, then reading microexpressions is an easy way to incentivize more gazing.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted"><strong>Speed</strong>: Microexpressions happen incredibly quickly—in less than a second. Anything longer than a second is simply a facial expression. Why is this important? Microexpressions (less than a second) cannot be controlled, so they are honest views into emotions. Facial expressions (longer than a second) can be faked and are less honest. Therefore, you should look at brief flashes of facial responsiveness for the most accurate reading.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4 class="x05-Head-B"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_108" title="108"/>Step #1: Spotting</h4>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">According to Dr. Paul Ekman, when you are speaking with someone, these are the seven reactions you should look out for:<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber58" id="SuperscriptNumber58"><sup class="endnote">7</sup></a><span id="footnote-010-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink" href="40_Footnote_10.xhtml">*</a></span></p>
			<h5 class="x05-Head-C">Anger</h5>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">We flash signs of anger when we feel displeasure at others or annoyance with a situation.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The anger microexpression is marked by:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-First">Lowered eyebrows that are pinched together</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Two vertical creases in between the eyebrows</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Tensing of the lower eyelids</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Last">Tightening of the lips—either pressed firmly together or in a position to yell</li>
			</ul>

				<img alt="" class="w100" id="image_pageMap_108" src="../image/56_Anger_Graphic.jpg"/>

			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-First">During a confrontation</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">When delivering bad news</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Before an argument or fight</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Photo alert: Accidentally in a profile photo when someone is squinting into the sun or does not like being in front of the camera</li>

			<h5 class="x05-Head-C"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_109" title="109"/>Contempt</h5>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Contempt—scorn, disdain, or disrespect—is quite a powerful and complex emotion that is marked by an extremely simple facial gesture. Contempt is often called “smirking” because it is a one-sided mouth raise.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><strong>Here’s what’s interesting about contempt: It confuses us.</strong> We offer a microexpression quiz for you to take in our Digital Bonuses at www.ScienceofPeople.com/toolbox. Over 22,000 people have taken this quiz. Contempt is the one that gets the most wrong answers. Of all the emotions, contempt seems to stump 40 percent of people (followed closely by fear, which 35 percent of people get wrong).</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Contempt confuses us because we mistake the smirk for a partial smile or boredom, but that could not be further from the truth. Contempt is a cue of serious dislike and scorn. We often show contempt when we feel that someone or something is beneath our attention.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The contempt microexpression is marked by:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-First">A one-sided cheek lift</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Pulling up the right or left corner of the mouth</li>

			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Woo-hoo! We have already learned the microexpression for happiness in Chapter 1. Genuine happiness is marked by the lifting of the upper cheek muscles, officially called the orbicularis oculi and zygomaticus major muscles. You know you are seeing a real smile when you see those lovely crow’s-feet wrinkles around the eyes.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The happiness microexpression is marked by:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-First">Corners of the lips equally pulled up</li>

				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Engaged upper cheek muscles</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Last">Wrinkling along the sides of the eyes</li>

				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">They’re feeling tired or overwhelmed but trying to look positive</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Photo alert: Accidentally in a profile picture when trying to look relaxed</li>
			</ul>
			<h5 class="x05-Head-C">Fear</h5>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">When we are afraid, our body often goes into fight-or-flight response. Our facial expression actually helps us respond quickly and accurately to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_111" title="111"/>threats. As soon as we are afraid, our eyes widen and our eyebrows go up our forehead—this way we can take in as much of our environment as possible to look for potential escapes or more threats. Then, our mouth opens and we gasp for breath—taking in oxygen in case we have to yell for help or flee.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The fear microexpression is marked by:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-First">Widened eyes</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Lifting of the upper eyelids</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Elevated eyebrows with horizontal lines in the center of the forehead</li>

				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-First">During a dangerous situation</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">When you give someone difficult information</li>

			</ul>
			<h5 class="x05-Head-C">Surprise</h5>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Surprise is a great truth-telling emotion. For example, if you ask a colleague, “Did you know I was going to be taken off the project?” surprise will tell you instantly that they had no idea. If they show fear, it can be a clue of their previous knowledge.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Surprise is easy to spot because it is the longest of the microexpressions. The mouth drops open and the eyebrows shoot up the forehead.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_112" title="112"/>The surprise microexpression is marked by:</p>

				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Last">Photo alert: In a picture when someone is ambushed by a camera</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><strong>Special Tip:</strong> The easiest way to tell the difference between fear and surprise is the shape of the eyebrows. Fear is marked by flat eyebrows with horizontal lines across the forehead. In surprise, the eyebrows are rounded like upside-down <em>U</em>s.</p>

			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">When we experience something unpleasant, revolting, or repulsive, we show disgust. It is the face you make when you smell something bad. Imagine a kid eating spinach for the first time: “Ewwwww” they say, with their nose crinkled up and a flash of their upper teeth.</p>

			</div>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">You often see a disgust microexpression in the following situations:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-First">When someone smells or tastes something bad</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">If they don’t like a person or an idea</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">During an unpleasant interaction</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Photo alert: In a picture if they’re trying to force themselves to look happy but hate being photographed</li>
			</ul>
			<h5 class="x05-Head-C">Sadness</h5>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">This is the expression most accurately portrayed by emoticons. A frowny face really does mean that someone is in a downy place. Sadness is the hardest microexpression to fake, so when you see it you know that you have hit a deep feeling. It is also the precursor expression to crying, so it can help you predict when someone is going to burst into tears.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_114" title="114"/>The sadness microexpression is marked by:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-First">Corners of the eyebrows pinched together</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Drooping of the eyelids</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Puffing or pouting of the lower lip</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Pulling the corners of the mouth down into a frown</li>

				<img alt="" class="w100" id="image_pageMap_114_0" src="../image/63_Sadness_Graphic.jpg"/>
			</div>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">You often see a sadness microexpression in the following situations:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-First">When someone is disappointed</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Right before they’re about to cry</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">If they’re overwhelmed or upset</li>
			</ul>
			<h4 class="x05-Head-B">Step #2: Responding</h4>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">While microexpressions give you tremendous insight into someone’s emotional state, spotting them is only the first step of the Decoder hack. Choosing a response comes next. Here are a few strategies.</p>
			<h5 class="x05-Head-C">Anger</h5>
			<div class="w80c">
				<img alt="" class="w100" id="image_pageMap_114_1" src="../image/64_Anger_in_the_Wild.jpg"/>
			</div>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">When I see anger, I think <strong>opportunity</strong>. Why? If you spot anger, you know that you have the opportunity to explain, dispel, and get to the truth.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_115" title="115"/>Let’s say, for example, you are pitching a project to a new client. The presentation is going swimmingly—they seem very engaged, are asking great questions, and nodding along with your points. Then you get to the price. Right as you mention the cost of the project, your client flashes anger at you—across the boardroom table you can easily see those two vertical lines appear between their eyebrows.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><strong>Typical Response:</strong> If you continue with your pitch, you leave questions unanswered. Yet the typical response is to just barrel through the rest of the material you planned to present and hope the anger evaporates. At the end of your talk, you’d be lucky if your client brought up his or her suspicions on pricing. Most wouldn’t. Then you’d be stuck wondering why they said no.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><strong>Using the Decoder: </strong>Immediately pause and explain the reasons you arrived at your price—so your client has the full context and understands your perspective. Then, before moving on to your next slide, ask if there are any remaining questions about the price. Once you have finished the pitch, circle back to the price and see if you still spot the anger.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><strong>How to Respond:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Explore—where is the anger coming from and how can you oust it?</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Stay Calm—not offensive or defensive.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Explain—what information can you give them to feel less threatened?</li>
			</ul>
			<h5 class="x05-Head-C">Contempt</h5>
			<div class="w80c">
				<img alt="" class="w100" id="image_pageMap_115" src="../image/65_Contempt_in_the_Wild.jpg"/>
			</div>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">When I see contempt, I think <strong>red flag</strong>. Contempt is a devious little emotion. When it isn’t addressed, it festers and grows into deep disrespect and hatred. This is why you need to tackle it the moment you see it.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Remember that spotting contempt doesn’t mean that someone is a contemptuous person or that they think <em>you</em> are a contemptuous person. People can have disdain for an idea or a situation while still having a <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_116" title="116"/>great relationship with you. This is why it is important to identify the trigger and talk it through so you can use it to strengthen your relationship and learn more about them.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Let’s say you are working with a colleague on a new project. You sit down over coffee to hammer out the details. You easily agree on a fair way to divvy up the project tasks and move on to the timeline. When you mention your six-week goal, you spot a microexpression of contempt.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><strong>Typical Response: </strong>Ignore it—you know it’s a tight turnaround, but it’s all hands on deck for this one. Six weeks later, you are surprised when your colleague says he is at least two weeks behind. Now it’s up to you to pick up the slack.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><strong>A Hacker’s Response: </strong>Go into information-seeking mode and figure out exactly what your colleague is worried about. What are his expectations for deliverables? How can you re-evaluate to help him (and you) get this project done on time? Either decide on a new timeline or change the deliverables to be more equitable.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><strong>How to Respond:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Find the source—what exactly is causing this contempt?</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Re-evaluate—how can you address the contemptuous issue?</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Build rapport—where can you agree?</li>
			</ul>
			<h5 class="x05-Head-C">Happiness</h5>
			<div class="w80c">
				<img alt="" class="w100" id="image_pageMap_116" src="../image/66_Fake_Happiness_in_the_Wild.jpg"/>
			</div>
			<p class="x12-Caption-2">Fake happiness (above) sends completely different social signals than real happiness.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">When I see happiness, I think <strong>celebration</strong>! Happiness is one of the most beautiful and joyous emotions—savor it, capitalize on it, celebrate it! Don’t let happiness go unnoticed.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Let’s say your partner had an amazing day at work. He bursts through the door right as you are cooking dinner. He whistles as he takes off his coat and saunters into the kitchen shouting, “Hey, honey, I have great news!” Hugging you from behind, he asks if there is any champagne to celebrate. You turn and see he is beaming with a huge smile.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><strong>Typical Response: </strong>You have pasta on boil, veggies sautéing, and wine <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_117" title="117"/>already open—“No, we can’t chill champagne, I just opened this bottle of red!” you say. Then, “Babe, watch out, the pasta is hot, I have to keep stirring.” As you try to finish making dinner, you say to your partner, “Tell me the good news as you set the table.” Your partner is a little deflated. He still shares the news, but doesn’t feel nearly as excited as he did when he came home. You have a normal dinner.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><strong>A Hacker’s Response: </strong>“Tell me! Tell me! Let me turn this heat down so you can tell me everything,” you exclaim. He shares his major win at work while you put a cork in your wine and throw a bottle of champagne into the fridge. “We have to celebrate,” you say. Dinner takes a little bit longer, but you get to clink glasses and ride the high of his work win together.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><strong>How to Respond:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Celebrate—smile with them, savor the moment.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Capitalize—ask for details, jump into the joy with them.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Express gratitude—tell them you are so excited they wanted to share their happiness with you.</li>
			</ul>
			<h5 class="x05-Head-C">Fear</h5>
			<div class="w80c">
				<img alt="" class="w100" id="image_pageMap_117" src="../image/67_Fear_in_the_Wild.jpg"/>
			</div>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">When I see fear, I think <strong>there must be more</strong>.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">It’s your mother’s birthday and you have a big family get-together planned. It’s going to be a fun party—she’s turning sixty, so you and your siblings saved up to get her an iPad for her to watch her favorite shows while she cooks.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">After dinner, your mom begins opening presents. She gets to yours and goes all teary-eyed while reading the card from you and your siblings. After ripping off the wrapping paper, she looks down at the brand-new iPad and leather case. She flashes a microexpression of fear before gushing about how generous her children are. Then she rushes off to serve the cake.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><strong>Typical Response: </strong>Nailed it! You and your siblings are very proud of your gift. You can’t wait for your mom to use it. A few weeks later, she still <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_118" title="118"/>hasn’t taken it out of the box. A few months later, she has opened it and put it in the case, but refuses to do more than play Scrabble on the free app you downloaded for her. Why did you get her this nice gift if she isn’t going to use it!?</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><strong>A Hacker’s Response: </strong>After cake, you take your mom aside and ask her if she is excited about the iPad. “Of course!” she says. But you spot that fear again. You offer to come over in the next few days and give her a tutorial on the iPad. She sighs with relief.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">After a few sessions, she has figured out Netflix and her e-mail. You also sign her up for a free iPad class offered at the Apple Store. She comes back with a list of cool new apps she thinks <em>you</em> would like. Nailed it!</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><strong>How to Respond:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Address—what’s the threat? What is the source of discomfort?</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Soothe—how can you make it safer?</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Comfort—can you reassure, re-evaluate, or remove the threat?</li>
			</ul>
			<h5 class="x05-Head-C">Surprise</h5>
			<div class="w50r">
				<img alt="" class="w100" id="image_pageMap_118" src="../image/68_Surprise_in_the_Wild.jpg"/>
			</div>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">When I see surprise, <strong>I hope we are on the same page</strong>. Sometimes, you mean to evoke surprise—using a conversation sparker or delivering good news. Other times, their surprise surprises you.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">You’re having lunch with an old friend. It’s been forever since you have been able to catch up, so you spend the first twenty minutes just updating each other on what’s been going on in your lives. The appetizers finally come and you begin to reminisce about college.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Can you believe,” you ask, “that Robby just got engaged?!” Your friend flashes a look of surprise.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><strong>Typical Response: </strong>You assume she knows—doesn’t everyone? Sure, Robby didn’t post about it on Facebook (he doesn’t use Facebook because of his job). But you figure it’s common knowledge. You breeze past the topic. A few days later, you hear through the grapevine that you spilled the beans. Robby was waiting to tell his parents before sending out announcements to everyone—your leak got back to them before he could share his news. Oops. You are definitely not invited to the wedding.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><strong>A Hacker’s Response: </strong>You spot the surprise and clarify, “Didn’t you know?” Your friend shakes her head and says, “I had no idea!” Thinking <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_119" title="119"/>quickly, you say, “Hey, I’m sure he’ll want to tell everyone himself—if you can keep it under wraps until he announces, that would be great.” Crisis averted. Wedding open bar is in your future.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><strong>How to Respond:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Clarify—do they know what you know?</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Qualify—what needs to happen next?</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Equate—how can you get on the same page?</li>
			</ul>
			<h5 class="x05-Head-C">Disgust</h5>
			<div class="w80c">
				<img alt="" class="w100" id="image_pageMap_119" src="../image/69_Disgust_in_the_Wild.jpg"/>
			</div>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">When I see disgust, I think <strong>we better get to the bottom of this</strong>. People often flash disgust when they are trying to think of a polite way to say they don’t like something. When we are worried about offending people, we keep our true feelings of disgust under wraps. However, if you want to get to the truth, you have to give people permission to express their real feelings.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Let’s say you are hiring a new employee. Everything in the interview is going great—he has a solid résumé and a positive attitude. As you explain the different parts of the job, you notice that your interviewee flashes disgust when bringing up that the job is paperwork heavy. There is a lot of filing, alphabetizing, and photocopying that happens at the end of each week.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><strong>Typical Response: </strong>Hope for the best. Everything looks good and you really think he is a great candidate for the position. You are shocked when at the end of his first month, none of your client invoices have been sent out. Why? There was a bottleneck in the filing system. He had been pushing off his weekly paperwork tasks and now all of your payments are late.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><strong>A Hacker’s Response: </strong>Noticing the disgust, you ask the candidate if he did much paperwork in the past. “Oh no,” he says, “I am great with strategy and ideas, but not great at organization.” He tells you in his last job he had an office assistant help with those tasks. After the interview, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_120" title="120"/>you go back to your boss to approve budget to hire him a secretary. He’s worth it, so you want to focus on his strengths and delegate his weaknesses.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Once he joins the staff, the entire office increases efficiency and you’re able to double production.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><strong>How to Respond:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Permission—let them tell you how they really feel.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Openness—everyone is entitled to his or her opinion.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Solve—how can you fix the dislike?</li>
			</ul>
			<h5 class="x05-Head-C">Sadness</h5>
			<div class="w80c">
				<img alt="" class="w100" id="image_pageMap_120" src="../image/70_Sadness_in_the_Wild.jpg"/>
			</div>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">When I see sadness, I think <strong>empathy</strong>.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Let’s say you are working with a contractor to redesign a bathroom in your house. The contractor comes highly recommended from your neighbors and you love his work. You have talked on the phone, but today the contractor is going to evaluate the scope of the project and give you a bid. When he comes up to the front door, you shake hands and say, “Nice to meet you. How are you?” He says, “I’m all right,” but you notice a microexpression of sadness.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><strong>Typical Response: </strong>You have work to do! You are hoping and praying the project is within your budget. You offer the contractor some water and then tour the bathroom. After a few minutes, the contractor says he has all he needs. You are shocked—he spent no more than ten minutes in the space and barely measured anything! As he is gathering his stuff, you ask for an estimated price. He gives you a number double what you expected. There is no way you can do it. Looks like you will be stuck with the old bathroom or have to start from scratch finding a new contractor.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><strong>A Hacker’s Response: </strong>You spot the sadness so you ask, “Yeah? Everything ok?” The contractor sighs and says, “Long day, you know those?” You <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_121" title="121"/>get him a glass of water and say, “Those are rough. Is anything wrong?” He tells you that he just found out his father’s in the hospital. He can’t run over and check on him until after your appointment. You immediately tell him that you can reschedule. He should definitely be with his father.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The next day, he calls to say everything is fine—it was just a false alarm, but he is so grateful for your understanding. He comes back that afternoon in a great mood and gives you an excellent price on the project.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><strong>How to Respond:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Understanding—what is causing the sadness?</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Empathy—how can you help?</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Space—how much time do they need to recover?</li>
			</ul>
			<h4 class="x05-Head-B">Step #3: Understand Outliers</h4>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">While the seven microexpressions are universal, there are a few special exceptions I want you to keep in mind before diving into the world of facial responsiveness.</p>
			<h5 class="x05-Head-C">The Eyebrow Raise</h5>
			<div class="w80c">
				<img alt="" class="w100" id="image_pageMap_121" src="../image/71_Eyebrow_Raise_rev.jpg"/>
			</div>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">An isolated eyebrow raise might look like partial surprise, but it is actually an indication of interest. We raise our eyebrows as if to say, “Oh really?” or “Fascinating!” Offering affirmation like this is an excellent addition to the Triple Threat.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">You can also use the eyebrow raise to highlight something important you’re saying. For example, teachers often raise their eyebrows when they get to a particularly important part of their lesson. This is a subconscious <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_122" title="122"/>way we call attention to our words. And, frequently, the most engaged student listeners will raise their eyebrows right back to show that they find it interesting, too.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><strong>Eyebrow raises show:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Engagement</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Attention</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Curiosity</li>
			</ul>
			<h5 class="x05-Head-C">Facial Punctuators</h5>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Just as we use our hands to emphasize our words, we use rapid facial movements to accent or punctuate what’s being said.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber59" id="SuperscriptNumber59"><sup class="endnote">8</sup></a> For example, we might bite our lips to show nervousness or puff out our cheeks to show frustration. This is a way we add dimension or expressiveness to our verbal communication.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Facial punctuators are a normal part of interaction. Occasionally, people will use one of the seven microexpressions as their facial punctuator. For example, Simon Cowell, the infamous <em>American Idol</em> judge who rips contestants to shreds, uses contempt as his facial punctuator. No wonder he’s stereotyped as the critical one. Yet for him, contempt is a means of accenting his statements, and isn’t necessarily a sign of inner derision.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">If you notice someone using one of the seven microexpressions frequently along with their words, it might just be their facial punctuator.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Facial punctuators:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Highlight ideas</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Accent words</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Can be one of the seven microexpressions</li>
			</ul>
			<h5 class="x05-Head-C">Squelching</h5>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Squelching is the result of trying to hide a microexpression, which creates a mishmash of facial gestures.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Have you ever tried to suppress a yawn? Your body has a really hard time stopping itself, so you make a crazy expression—squishing your eyes closed, cranking your mouth shut and tensing your cheek muscles. It’s a very similar feeling and look when someone tries to hide or contain a microexpression. It can be an indication of embarrassment or a concealed lie.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_123" title="123"/>If you notice someone make a squelched expression, be sure to dig deeper to find the source of the disguise.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Squelching can be seen if someone is:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Lying</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Embarrassed of their reaction</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Hiding their true feelings</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="x05-Head-A">THE SCIENCE OF SELFIES</h3>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">These days, we very rarely have the luxury of making a first impression in person. An interviewer Googles you before your interview, a potential client adds you on LinkedIn after getting your e-mail, or you meet someone on Tinder before going out on a real date. The question is: <strong>What does your digital microexpression say?</strong></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">When making a first impression, you get the luxury of a few seconds in real life—online it’s not so cushy. Princeton University researcher Dr. Alexander Todorov found that you make a snap judgment about someone online within 100 milliseconds of seeing their picture.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber60" id="SuperscriptNumber60"><sup class="endnote">9</sup></a></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The good news is that you’re in control of the messages you send in your photo. Whether you have an e-mail avatar, a social media profile picture, or a business head shot, you can use the seven microexpressions to send the right signals.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">In another experiment, Dr. Todorov found that different images of the same person can create drastically different first impressions. Participants changed their minds about a person’s intelligence, trustworthiness, and attractiveness depending on what picture they were looking at.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber61" id="SuperscriptNumber61"><sup class="endnote">10</sup></a></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">We did a mini-experiment in our lab that we called Hot or Not, indeed using the website HotorNot.com. If you’re unfamiliar, visitors to the website “rate” pictures of strangers. We coded four hundred photos of men and women and found that the “hottest” photos had different patterns than the photos with the lowest scores.<span id="footnote-009-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink" href="41_Footnote_11.xhtml">*</a></span></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Specifically in regard to microexpressions—photos with fake smiles or closed mouth smiles got lower ratings. Be sure your profile pictures <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_124" title="124"/>aren’t accidentally showing negative microexpressions. Common mistakes are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-First">Showing contempt in an attempt to look casual</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Flashing fake happiness in lieu of a real smile</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Squinting in the sun, which looks like an anger microexpression</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Last">Blinking or reacting to a flash, causing an accidental look of fear</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Check your online photos to make sure you’re projecting a strong digital first impression.</p>
			<h3 class="x05-Head-A">MICROEXPRESSION CHALLENGE</h3>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">A book can teach you only so much about microexpressions. The best way to exercise your Decoder muscles is with video—you can slow it down, pause it, and speed it up.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">We have created Watch Guides for some of our favorite TV shows so you can practice spotting, decoding, and exercising your facial-reading muscles. The Watch Guides are like <em>Where’s Waldo?</em> for facial expressions. All you have to do is follow along with each episode and see if you can spot all of the clues. It’s super addictive! It’s also the best way to see facial expressions “in the wild.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">We have all these free for you in your Digital Bonuses at www.ScienceofPeople.com/toolbox. Just download the Watch Guide and see if you can spot all of the expressions. I also frequently tweet about microexpressions I see during debates, newscasts, and recent events. So be sure to follow me @Vvanedwards on social media.</p>
			<h3 class="x05-Head-A">FOLLOW YOUR INSTINCT</h3>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">One final reminder: Follow your instincts.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Just as we are wired to show microexpressions, we are also wired to read them. This hack teaches you the names for what you already know. If you ever forget what a facial expression means or can’t recognize an expression, try to mimic it. When you copy a facial expression, you will often feel the emotion it portrays. This is because of something called the facial feedback hypothesis.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber62" id="SuperscriptNumber62"><sup class="endnote">11</sup></a></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The hypothesis is that our facial expressions and our emotions are <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_125" title="125"/>connected in a loop. When you feel an emotion, it is expressed on your face. On the other hand, when you have an expression on your face, you also feel that emotion. This is a great ninja tip—if you want to really feel as someone else feels, copy their expression to glimpse their inner state.</p>

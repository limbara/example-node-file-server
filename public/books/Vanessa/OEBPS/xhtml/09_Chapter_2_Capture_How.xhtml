			<h2 class="x03-Chapter-Title">CAPTURE</h2>
			<h2 class="x03-Chapter-Subtitle">How to make a killer first impression</h2>
			<p class="x03-CO-Body-Text"><span class="_idGenDropcap-1">T</span>he audience sits in hushed anticipation. The Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra is already assembled onstage, tuning their instruments expectantly. The sold-out Heinz Hall is filled with 2,676 people. Everyone is waiting for conductor Arild Remmereit to take the stage.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The problem is that Remmereit is not supposed to be here. The audience knows it, the orchestra knows it, and Remmereit certainly knows it. When the famed German conductor Christoph von Dohnányi became ill a few days before the show, the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra had to find an immediate replacement. They turned to Remmereit.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber10" id="SuperscriptNumber10"><sup class="endnote">1</sup></a></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">In a matter of days, Remmereit, a tall, energetic Norwegian, had to find a way to learn and conduct Dohnáyi’s entire program with an orchestra he had never worked with before. Of the three scheduled pieces in the program, Remmereit had only ever conducted one before in concert.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">When I interviewed Remmereit, he confessed, “Before walking out I was incredibly nervous and was going on almost no sleep to get ready for the performance.”<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber11" id="SuperscriptNumber11"><sup class="endnote">2</sup></a> To add even more pressure, <em>New York Times</em> reviewer James R. Oestreich was in the audience.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">As Remmereit finally takes the stage, the audience holds its breath. He has only a few seconds to make a strong first impression. For Remmereit it’s all about “finding a way to create trust.” He has to convince the audience that he can lead them through a new set and show the orchestra they should follow him.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“He approached the podium like a diffident schoolboy. But once there he showed utter self-assurance, using clear and wide-ranging gestures,” observed Oestreich.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber12" id="SuperscriptNumber12"><sup class="endnote">3</sup></a></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_37" title="37"/>Remmereit leads the orchestra through a sensational performance of Wagner’s <em>Siegfried Idyll</em> and then a dynamic reading of Schumann’s Fourth Symphony. He finishes with Brahms’s Second Piano Concerto and finally a Chopin waltz as the encore. The audience is thrilled.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“The only thing listeners seemed to want to talk about afterward was Mr. Remmereit,” reported Oestreich. “Mr. Remmereit radiated a joy in music-making, several listeners said. Inevitably, his boyish good looks, expressive podium manner and understated charisma were noted, but so was what some perceived as an unusual rapport between conductor and players.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The news of Remmereit’s magnetic performance spread. He was quickly re-hired in Pittsburgh and made additional debuts with the Baltimore Symphony, Milan’s Filarmonica della Scala, Munich Philharmonic, and the Vienna Symphony.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“The musicians know within five minutes whether a new conductor is any good or not,” he said later.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber13" id="SuperscriptNumber13"><sup class="endnote">4</sup></a> What did he do right in those first five minutes?</p>
			<h3 class="x05-Head-A">THE SCIENCE OF FIRST IMPRESSIONS</h3>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Have you ever met someone who you just clicked with—within the first few seconds you somehow knew that you would get along? Have you ever met someone who rankled you right from the start—you don’t know exactly what it was, but something about them just bothered you?</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Whether we like to admit it or not, we decide if we like someone, if we trust someone, and if we want a relationship with someone within the first few seconds of meeting them.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber14" id="SuperscriptNumber14"><sup class="endnote">5</sup></a> However, we rarely think about our first impressions. And if we do, we aren’t quite sure how to make them better. So we practice what we want to say, we plan witty jokes, and hope for the best when it comes to those early moments.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Researchers Nalini Ambady and Robert Rosenthal at Harvard University wanted to test the power of our snap judgments. They decided to look at students’ perceptions of their professors.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber15" id="SuperscriptNumber15"><sup class="endnote">6</sup></a> Our judgments of teachers <em>should</em> only be made based on their actual teaching content—not on their looks, behavior, or presence. However, this is not how we operate.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">For the experiment, Ambady and Rosenthal showed muted ten-second video clips of professors teaching to outside participants, who rated the teachers on fifteen dimensions of effectiveness, including warmth, optimism, and professionalism. The evaluators had to make judgments based entirely on nonverbal cues.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_38" title="38"/>Ambady and Rosenthal looked at the results and wondered if they could change the ratings by shortening the clips. So they cut the clips from ten seconds to five seconds. The ratings did not change. Then they cut the clips from five seconds to two seconds. <strong>The ratings still did not change.</strong> They concluded that we make a snap judgment in the first two seconds of meeting someone and we rarely adjust it—even when we get more information. <strong>We decide if we believe someone, if we like someone, and if we trust someone before we have even heard him or her speak.</strong></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">What character judgments could you confidently make after watching someone move in a room for two seconds? Could you guess how honest they are? How nice? How supportive? Even though you would have very little content to judge, you already mentally ask and answer these questions within seconds of meeting someone. And the crazy part is you’re pretty accurate!</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Here’s the most interesting part of the study. Ambady and Rosenthal took the ratings from each of these clips and compared them to the student evaluations of these same teachers after an entire semester of classes. Again, they were surprisingly similar. <strong>Teachers who got poor rankings from the two-second clips also got low rankings from students who took a semester’s worth of classes.</strong></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">You can bet that those teachers spent many hours agonizing over their curriculum, practicing their teaching method, and spending time bonding with students before and after classes. According to Ambady and Rosenthal, this is not what really mattered. Students decide how effective teachers are within the first few seconds of walking into the room. The same thing happens to Remmereit when he takes the stage. And the same thing happens to you when you enter a room.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Intimidated by the speed of the first impression? Don’t be! This is good news. If it takes only a few seconds to convince someone you are worth talking to, let’s supercharge these first few seconds. <strong>You can use the first impression to hack an entire interaction.</strong></p>
			<h3 class="x05-Head-A">LEVELING UP</h3>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">First impressions are a survival mechanism. When you meet a new person, you have to quickly decide if you want them in your life. Ever heard of the fight-or-flight response? It is a way your body instinctively reacts to external stimuli and decides if you should stay or flee. This is why first impressions are so swift and decisive.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_39" title="39"/>We are trying to answer three basic questions about a new person during the first few moments of an interaction.</p>
			<p class="x07-List-Unnumbered-First"><strong>Level One: </strong>Are you friend or foe? This is our subconscious personal safety check. We’re thinking, “Darlin’ you got to let me know. Should I stay or should I go?”</p>
			<p class="x07-List-Unnumbered"><strong>Level Two: </strong>Are you a winner or loser? When we first meet someone, we want to quickly assess their confidence—do they look like a leader or a follower?</p>
			<p class="x07-List-Unnumbered-Last"><strong>Level Three:</strong> Are you an ally or an enemy? It’s one thing to see someone as nonthreatening, but the last level is when you decide whether someone should be on your team. Your brain wants to know if this person likes you enough to back you up.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">When someone successfully answers all three questions, we “level up” and trust them more. Strangers become acquaintances. Acquaintances become friends. Prospects become clients. (These are, of course, the three questions people are also trying to quickly answer about <em>you</em>.) How does this phenomenon play out when a speaker is in front of a big audience? In a TED Talk, for example?</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">I’m a TED Talk junkie. Most days, I find a juicy talk at lunch to accompany my sandwich. One day, I typed “leadership” into the search bar and two videos popped up. One was “How Great Leaders Inspire Action” by Simon Sinek, and the other was “Learning from Leadership’s Missing Manual” by Fields Wicker-Miurin.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Both talks were about eighteen minutes long. Both talks came out in September 2009. Both talks were given by respected thought leaders in their field. But there was one difference—and it was a big one. Sinek’s talk had 24,905,052 views, while Wicker-Miurin’s had only 725,663. Why such a big discrepancy? By virtue of being selected for TED Talks, both speakers were vetted prior to their presentation. TED goes to great lengths to keep their presentation style consistent and pick the best speakers from around the world. All of these speakers have amazing ideas. What gives?<span id="footnote-003-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink" href="32_Footnote_2.xhtml">*</a></span> I designed a research experiment in our lab to find out.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_40" title="40"/>We wanted to see if Ambady and Rosenthal’s findings could be applied to TED. First, we had a group of participants watch full-length TED Talks and give each speaker a score on credibility, charisma, intelligence, and overall performance. Participants were not able to see the view counts (to avoid skewing their perceptions) and we verified they had not seen the talks before.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Next, we gave scoring sheets to a second group, who saw seven-second clips of the same TED Talks. Guess what? No significant difference in opinion.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Is it possible that we decide if we are going to like a TED Talk within the first seven seconds? How do the top TED Talkers pass through all three levels of trust so quickly?</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">We had our coders analyze hundreds of hours of TED Talks looking for differences between the least and most viewed videos. We counted hand gestures and measured vocal variety, smiling, and body movement. We found that there were patterns. <strong>The power of our first impression lies not in </strong><span class="BOLD_ITAL">what </span><strong>we say, but</strong><span class="BOLD_ITAL"> how </span><strong>we say it.</strong></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><strong>The most popular TED Talkers leveled up their audiences before even getting to their big idea. They did this by using what I call:</strong></p>
			<p class="x06-Extract-A-First">HACK #2: The Triple Threat</p>
			<p class="x06-Extract-A-Last">Make a powerful first impression by nonverbally hacking all three levels of trust.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">In showbiz, performers are a Triple Threat when they can act, sing, and dance. With a first impression, you are a Triple Threat when you use your hands, your posture, and your eye contact. These are the three nonverbal weapons you can use to pass through all three levels of trust. These are what Arild Remmereit uses when he enters the stage. They are what the top TED Talkers use on that little red carpet. And they are what you should use anytime you are interacting with someone.</p>
			<h4 class="x05-Head-B">Skill #1: Use Your Hands</h4>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">The top TED Talkers use a very specific mechanism to instantly build trust with their audience: hand gestures.</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-First">The least popular TED Talkers used an average of <strong>272</strong> hand gestures—yes, our coders painstakingly counted every single one.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_41" title="41"/>The most popular TED Talkers used an average of <strong>465 </strong>hand gestures—that’s almost double!</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Last">Temple Grandin, Simon Sinek, and Jane McGonigal topped the hand gesture charts with over <strong>600</strong> gestures in just eighteen minutes.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">This effect isn’t specific to TED Talks. Robert Gifford, Cheuk Fan Ng, and Margaret Wilkinson found that job candidates who use more hand gestures in their interviews are more likely to get hired.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber16" id="SuperscriptNumber16"><sup class="endnote">7</sup></a> Why do hand gestures have such an impact? Hands show intention.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Think back to caveman days for a moment. When a stranger approached our caveman ancestors, the best way to tell if the stranger had good or bad intentions was to look at their hands. Were they carrying a rock or a spear? As the stranger introduced themselves, our ancestors watched their gestures to make sure they weren’t going to reach out and attack or steal precious belongings. Even though in modern times we aren’t often subjected to physical harm, this survival mechanism remains. This is why in most cultures we shake hands as a way of greeting. And why the first thing police officers yell at criminals is “Get your hands up!”</p>

				<div class="Fast-Fact">
					<p class="x09-Box-Title">FAST FACT BOX</p>
					<p class="x09-Box-Text-Last">Most people think that we look at the eyes or the smile when we first meet someone. We don’t realize how important hands are.</p>
					<div class="w80c">

			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_42" title="42"/>When someone can see your hands, they feel more at ease and are more likely to befriend you. This is an easy one to implement. When you walk into a room or are waiting to meet someone, keep your hands out of your pockets.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">I know, I know, putting your hands in your pockets is so comfortable! It’s so casual! It’s so cowboy! I don’t mean to get drastic, but pockets are <em>murderers</em> of rapport. Yeah, I said murderers. That’s because the absolute easiest thing you can do to improve your first impression is to keep your hands visible. Every time you put your hand in your pocket, just scream “MURDERER!” in your head. That will help you remember.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Pockets aren’t the only problem. Don’t let desks, purses, or laptops block your friend-makers. Whenever possible, keep your hands above the desk in a boardroom, on the table during a coffee meeting, and out of your purse during an event.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Getting handsy is a one-two punch for trust. First, you have your hands visible, and then you go in for the perfect handshake.</p>
			<h5 class="x05-Head-C">How to Give a Perfect Handshake</h5>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Are you friend or foe? A handshake shows a stranger you are safe enough to go palm to palm. But not all handshakes are created equal. Here are the top things you need to know about a great handshake:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-First"><strong>Dry: </strong>Nothing is worse than a slimy handshake. If you get nervous and your palms sweat, use my favorite “napkin wrap” trick. When you get to an event, order a drink from the bar and wrap a napkin around the glass. Hold this with your handshaking hand so the napkin catches your sweat before you shake.</li>
			</ul>
			<div class="w50c">
				<img alt="" class="w100" id="image_pageMap_42" src="../image/32_Glass_with_Napkin.jpg"/>
			</div>

			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted"><strong><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_43" title="43"/>Vertical: </strong>Always keep your hand vertical with your thumb toward the sky. Offering your palm up is a nonverbal submissive or weak gesture. And forcing someone into the palm-up position by putting your hand out palm down can be seen as domineering and controlling.</li>
			</ul>
			<div class="w80c">
				<img alt="" class="w100" id="image_pageMap_43" src="../image/33_Vertical_handshake_NEW.jpg"/>
			</div>

			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Last"><strong>Firm:</strong> Have you ever squeezed a peach to see if it was ripe? This is kind of the effect you want when shaking a hand, because everyone has slightly different ideas of firmness. With a peach, you squeeze until you feel a tiny bit of resistance. If it’s really ripe, this comes fast and you stop squeezing. If it’s not ready to be eaten, you can squeeze pretty hard without bruising the fruit. Same goes for people. Squeeze until you feel their muscles tighten, and then stop. And for goodness’ sake, never give someone a limp hand a.k.a. the “dead fish”—it’s deadly for rapport.<span id="footnote-002-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink" href="33_Footnote_3.xhtml">*</a></span></li>
			</ul>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Never, ever skip a handshake. Don’t replace it with a wave or a high five or—heaven forbid—a fist bump. Why? The moment we have skin-to-skin touch with someone, our body produces something called oxytocin.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><strong>Oxytocin is the connection hormone.</strong> Researcher Paul Zak discovered the power of this little hormone, which he calls “the moral molecule,” <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_44" title="44"/>to facilitate trust—this is why it is an essential part of answering the question “friend or foe?” Two million people have viewed his TED Talk. In it, he describes conducting experiments with oxytocin in which he manipulated the trust of participants simply by giving them a dose of the hormone.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">When you shake hands with someone, your body produces the exact hormone you both need to build trust—and then a deeper connection.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><strong>Bottom Line:</strong> Keep your hands visible. Never skip a handshake.</p>
			<h4 class="x05-Head-B">Skill #2: Be a Winner</h4>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Answer the following question:</p>
			<p class="x07-List-Head"><strong>What is the most influential factor for professionals who want to earn the trust of potential clients?</strong></p>
			<ol>
				<li class="x07-List-Numbered-Subentry">Being an established, proven expert</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Numbered-Subentry">Having a high degree of confidence</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Numbered-Subentry">Demonstrating advanced expertise in their area</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Numbered-Subentry-Last">Having a well-respected reputation</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">What did you guess? If you guessed “B. Having a high degree of confidence,” you are correct! According to a major study done by Carnegie Mellon University,<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber17" id="SuperscriptNumber17"><sup class="endnote">8</sup></a> a professional’s confidence is more important than that professional’s reputation, skill set, or history!</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Why is confidence so important? As humans, we are constantly looking for winners.</p>
			<p class="x06-Extract-1P"><strong>Winner:</strong> <em>n.</em> Victor; a person likely to be successful.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">We like to have winners on our team. We like to be associated with winners. We like to be led by winners. Whether we like it or not, in the first few seconds of an interaction, we are trying to decide if the person we are speaking with looks more like a winner or more like a loser. The question is: What does a winner look like?</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Researchers Jessica Tracy and David Matsumoto wanted to know if there are universal winner and loser behaviors. Specifically, they examined how humans respond to success and failure. To do this, they compared how Olympic athletes behave after they win or lose a race. Do sighted, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_45" title="45"/>blind, and congenitally blind (blind since birth) athletes display the same forms of pride and shame after a match? The answer is yes—<strong>across cultures, the behavior of winning and losing athletes was the same.</strong></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Even congenitally blind athletes, who have never seen an athlete finish a race or suffer a crushing defeat, somehow mimic the gestures of other athletes.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber18" id="SuperscriptNumber18"><sup class="endnote">9</sup></a></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Winners typically take up as much space as physically possible. Frequently called “Power Posing” this is when we raise our arms over our head, expand our chest, and tilt our head up:</p>
			<div class="w100">
				<img alt="" class="w100" id="image_pageMap_45" src="../image/34_Winner_Loser_Photo.jpg"/>
			</div>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Losing athletes take up as little physical space as possible. Also known as “Low Power Posing,” defeated athletes usually bow their head, slump their shoulders, and pin their arms tightly to their sides.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The fact that athletes instinctively use the same body language shows us how innately programmed we are to broadcast victory and defeat nonverbally. But why? Tracy and Matsumoto propose that pride and shame factor significantly in social signaling, providing rich information we use to make judgments of ourselves and others.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Like athletes, when we are proud, we want people to notice us, so we take up space. When we feel defeated, we try to deflect attention by taking up as little space as possible.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Now, as much as I want you to look like a winner, the traditional winner’s pose is a bit much for everyday interactions. It would be odd if you <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_46" title="46"/>ran into your meetings or dates like you just crossed a finish line—highly powerful, but a bit socially aggressive.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Instead, I use something I call the Launch Stance. This is a slightly toned-down version of the winner’s posture. <strong>Whenever you are talking to people, use your Launch Stance:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-First">Keep your shoulders down and back.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Aim your chin, chest, and forehead straight in front of you or slightly up.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Keep space between your arms and torso.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Make sure your hands are visible.</li>
			</ul>
			<div class="w100">
				<img alt="" class="w100" id="image_pageMap_46" src="../image/35_Launch_Stance.jpg"/>
			</div>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Body language is the fastest way you can showcase confidence to others and hack your winning first impression.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><strong>Special Note:</strong> Sometimes we accidentally go into loser body language when we check our phones. Think about it: You bow your head, cross your arms in front of your chest, pin your arms tightly to your sides, and slump your shoulders in. What do most of us do while waiting for a client or before going into a meeting? We check our phones! This terrible cycle has to stop now!</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">If possible, chat with colleagues, look calmly around the waiting room, or read a newspaper before an important engagement. If you want to check your phone, just do it like a winner. Pivot the phone out and up to align with the Launch Stance:</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><span class="_2-Figure-Callout"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_47" title="47"/></span><strong>Bottom Line:</strong> Stand like a winner. Look like a winner. Interact like a winner.</p>

			</div>
			<h4 class="x05-Head-B">Skill #3: Engage with Eye Contact</h4>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Once we have decided someone is both trustworthy and a winner, we want to know if they should be on our team or not. This is the differentiator between a good first impression and a great one. Specifically, we are looking for indicators of alliance. Does this person like me? Would this person respect my opinion? Will this person include me? Sure, we like people who are trustworthy and confident, but if we don’t think they will respect us, we never level them up.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Most TED Talkers pass only the first two levels. They may indicate their trustworthiness with hand gestures and capture confidence with a broad stance. However, most don’t know how to make the individuals in their audience feel cared for. They speak to the cameras, they speak to the slides, but they don’t speak to YOU.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">How do you communicate your desire for an alliance? Imagine you’re sipping on coffee during an afternoon break in a park. You see a mother reading a book on a blanket beside her toddler. The toddler spots a duck, so he looks up at his mom and says, “Look, a duck!” The mother doesn’t hear him, so her son pulls on her hand and says louder, “Mom! Look, I see a duck!” This time, Mom registers it and murmurs, “Uh-huh, nice, sweetie.” But the toddler isn’t fooled. His mom wasn’t <em>really</em> paying attention. So he starts jumping and tugging on his mother’s arm, chanting “Mom, Mom, Mom, MOM, MOM! MOM!!” Finally, right as the toddler begins to cry, the mother puts her book down, looks at her son and says, “What is it?” The toddler smiles and points at the duck. “Oh!” she exclaims, and looks over at <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_48" title="48"/>the duck with him. “How great! You love ducks,” she says, turning to him and smiling. He sighs happily, and they both resume relaxing.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">What happened? The toddler just wanted someone to share an experience with. Like all of us, he wanted an alliance. The best TED Talkers act much like a doting mother with their audience. They make eye contact with specific faces in the crowd and speak directly to them—making everyone watching feel like they truly matter. The sense of togetherness you get during a stellar TED Talk comes when you feel you are experiencing the slides and presentation along with the speaker. Viral TED Talkers speak <em>to</em> you, not <em>at</em> you.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">One of the most powerful examples of eye contact is in a video done by activist Jae West and her team at Liberators International. Their organization’s stated mission on their website: “We aim to coordinate, record and distribute monthly global acts of freedom.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Their YouTube channel is filled with many daring acts of kindness and unique public service announcements. In one video, the Liberators lead Australian subway passengers to sing an impromptu rendition of “Over the Rainbow.” In another video, a woman stands in her underwear on a public street blindfolded. She asks people to draw hearts on her body with a permanent marker to raise awareness for eating disorders.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber19" id="SuperscriptNumber19"><sup class="endnote">10</sup></a><span id="footnote-001-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink" href="34_Footnote_4.xhtml">*</a></span></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">One of their most popular videos is called “The World’s Biggest Eye Contact Experiment.” In this video, Liberators ask strangers to participate in one minute of sustained eye contact with another stranger. “We were definitely nervous going into it . . . it’s quite confronting to stare a stranger in the eye and allow yourself to be vulnerable,” said West.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The results were overwhelming. Over 100,000 people participated in the experiment in 156 cities around the world. After just one minute of eye contact, stranger after stranger ended their moment in tears, hugs, and astonishment. As West concluded, “Holding eye contact with another person can evoke many feelings . . . it calls on true courage to trust another being.”<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber20" id="SuperscriptNumber20"><sup class="endnote">11</sup></a></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Why is eye contact so powerful? It produces oxytocin, the chemical foundation for trust. We’re programmed to interpret it as a nonverbal signal of goodwill. When you like someone, you look at them more. Author Allan Pease describes it this way:</p>
			<p class="x06-Extract-1P"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_49" title="49"/>When person A likes person B, he will look at him a lot. This causes B to think that A likes him, so B will like A in return. In other words, in most cultures, to build a good rapport with another person, your gaze should meet theirs about 60 to 70 percent of the time. This will also cause them to begin to like you. It is not surprising, therefore, that the nervous, timid person who meets our gaze less than one third of the time is rarely trusted.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber21" id="SuperscriptNumber21"><sup class="endnote">12</sup></a></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">In those first few seconds, it’s especially important that you override the impulse to look away shyly.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">You may be worrying that you’ll use <em>too</em> much eye contact. How much is ideal? You may remember this question from the PQ quiz:</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><strong>In the average conversation, people typically hold eye contact what percent of the time?</strong></p>
			<ol>
				<li class="x07-List-Numbered-1-First" value="1">31 percent</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Numbered-1">51 percent</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Numbered-1">61 percent</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Numbered-1-Last">91 percent</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">I have asked this question to hundreds of audiences. The answers are usually evenly split. People have completely different ideas about how much eye contact is normal.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">British social psychologist Dr. Michael Argyle found that when Westerners and Europeans are in conversation, they tend to hold eye contact for an average of <strong>61 percent of the time</strong> (answer C). He found that 41 percent occurs while talking and 75 percent while listening.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber22" id="SuperscriptNumber22"><sup class="endnote">13</sup></a> Next time you’re talking to someone, try to objectively evaluate where you tend to fall on the spectrum. Some other things to keep in mind:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-First">Notice their eye color.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Don’t look over their head to scope out the scene.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Last">Hold eye contact for 60 to 70 percent of the time.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><strong>Bottom Line:</strong> Use eye contact to build trust. Gaze to produce connection.</p>

			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Making a killer first impression is not about banishing social anxiety once and for all. Before Arild Remmereit takes the stage, he still feels incredibly nervous. Famed TED Talker Dr. Brené Brown says giving her TED Talk was terrifying—and her talk is one of the most viewed TED videos of all time.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“One of the most anxiety-provoking experiences of my career was speaking at the TED Conference in Long Beach. In addition to all the normal fears associated with giving a filmed, eighteen-minute talk in front of an intensely successful and high-expectation audience, I was the closing speaker for the entire event,” recalled Brown.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">However, Brown took the stage like a champion, her shoulders back and her hands out. Then she made sure she could see her audience. “When I finally walked onto the stage the first thing I did was make eye contact with several people in the audience. I asked the stage managers to bring up the houselights so I could see people. I needed to feel connected,” said Brown.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber23" id="SuperscriptNumber23"><sup class="endnote">14</sup></a></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The Triple Threat is a tool you can turn to when your nerves are high. It will both simplify the process of making good first impressions—once you understand the science, it’s not so big and scary—and allow you to relax by living more in the moment. Along with the most popular TED Talkers and Remmereits, you can make your first few seconds count by nonverbally showing your audience: You can trust me, I have a winning idea, and I’m here to help you. That’s how we become memorable.</p>
			<h3 class="x05-Head-A">CHALLENGES</h3>
			<ol>
				<li class="x07-List-Numbered-1-First" value="1">Don’t guess on your handshake. Do a handshake audit with a trusted friend or colleague—ask for honest feedback to make sure your grip is just right.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Numbered-1">Use your Launch Stance during your next interaction—feel the difference?</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Numbered-1-Last">Practice engaging in 60 to 70 percent eye contact during your interactions.</li>

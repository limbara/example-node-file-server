			<h2 class="x03-Chapter-Number"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_260" title="260"/>CHAPTER 14</h2>
			<h2 class="x03-Chapter-Title">ENGAGE</h2>
			<h2 class="x03-Chapter-Subtitle">How to turn people on</h2>
			<p class="x03-CO-Body-Text"><span class="_idGenDropcap-1">M</span>y hero is coming to dinner.” This is what I said to my husband as I frantically prepared dinner, cleaned up the house, and tried to look as presentable as possible. <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of<em> Predictably Irrational</em>, behavioral science icon and TED Talk star Dan Ariely would be at my house in thirty minutes . . . and I was freaking out.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">A few months earlier, Ariely found my e-mail address and sent me a note saying he enjoyed my YouTube videos. After screaming for joy, briefly passing out, and overcoming a long bout of uncontrollable hiccups, I was able to reply coherently, and even mention some new research I was working on. Thus began our geeky friendship. Now Ariely and his wife were visiting Portland and stopping by for dinner.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The moment Ariely and his lovely wife, Sumi, walked through the door, I was starstruck. But I quickly realized that Ariely wasn’t there to impress us. He was there to learn. Over appetizers, dinner, and two bottles of wine, Ariely asked questions. Instead of talking about his groundbreaking work and research, he gently and curiously turned the spotlight on everyone else at the table. My husband’s work, his wife’s opinions, my goals. By the end of the evening, I was floating. I felt like I was on a relationship high—and it had nothing to do with Ariely’s professional accolades or fame. It had to do with his unique approach to people.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Dan Ariely has an intense curiosity. It comes across not only in his work—he has four books and five TED Talks with over 13 million views—but also in his everyday interactions. <strong>His sincere curiosity makes him incredibly engaging.</strong></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_261" title="261"/>Ariely’s inquisitive nature is also responsible, at least in part, for his tremendous success—beginning with his decision to follow his current career path. When Ariely was seventeen years old, he accidentally set off an explosion that burned 70 percent of his body.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber124" id="SuperscriptNumber124"><sup class="endnote">1</sup></a> For months, he went through excruciating surgeries and skin grafts. During this process, he faced the ultimate torture: getting bandages removed.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Have you ever had to take off an old Band-Aid? You can either rip it off quickly—a short, intense pain. Or you can pull it off slowly—less intense pain over a longer period of time. “The nurses in my department thought that the right approach was the ripping one, so they would grab hold and they would rip, and they would grab hold and they would rip. And because I had 70 percent of my body burned, it would take about an hour,” recalled Ariely.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">As soon as Ariely got out of the hospital, he enrolled in Tel Aviv University, where he began to do experiments on pain, tolerance, and relief. “At the end of this process, what I learned was that the nurses were wrong,” said Ariely.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">It turns out that the best possible way to minimize a patient’s pain is not to rip off the bandages quickly, but rather to go slower with less intensity. “My nurses had no idea,” explained Ariely.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber125" id="SuperscriptNumber125"><sup class="endnote">2</sup></a> They’d been confident in their opinion to the point of irrationality—despite the evidence staring them in the face.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">This simple, powerful discovery was the first of many for Ariely. He has built a career out of making seemingly irrational behavior predictable. He engages people with his distinctive brand of curiosity. And his inquisitiveness has brought him tremendous success.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">How can we adopt Ariely’s approach? In this final hack, let’s find out.</p>
			<h3 class="x05-Head-A">THE SCIENCE OF POPULARITY</h3>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">What makes someone popular? Researchers at Columbia University were surprised to find that popularity isn’t correlated with physical attractiveness, athleticism, intelligence, or humor, but to certain brain patterns. <strong>Specifically, popular people are more attuned to </strong><span class="BOLD_ITAL">other</span> <strong>people’s popularity.</strong></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">In their study, Noam Zerubavel and his team asked participants from two student groups to rank each other by popularity. They then put each participant in a brain scanner and flashed pictures of the group members <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_262" title="262"/>they had just ranked. They mixed in a few fake pictures. Students had to quickly press a button indicating whether the picture was real or fake.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">They found that all of the participants—regardless of their own popularity—had more brain activity in the reward center of the brain when viewing the faces of popular people from their group. Simply put: <strong>Popular people literally make us feel good.</strong> This might be why we are so drawn to watching celebrities on television.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">But here’s the most interesting part of the study: There was a significant difference in the brain response of the popular students. The most popular participants had the largest neural response when viewing fellow popular students, especially in the “social cognition” part of the brain. In other words, <strong>popular people are more attuned to social signals, social hierarchy, and relationships—and they place higher value on these cues</strong>.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Popular students were also more aware of their own social status and more accurate at guessing how well liked they were by others. The authors suggest that popular people are popular because they enjoy trying to understand what people around them are thinking and feeling. They call this enhanced social attunement.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber126" id="SuperscriptNumber126"><sup class="endnote">3</sup></a></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Now I understand what happened at dinner with Dan Ariely—I was hit full force by his ability to attune to me. The way he <em>thinks </em>changed the way I <em>felt.</em> First, let’s be real, my mental reward center tingled by his world-renowned social status. And then, my social cognition system kicked into thrilling gear by his desire to get to know me.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">This is how you turn people on. <strong>You don’t impress people by mentioning your accolades, accomplishments, or awards. You impress them by mentally turning on their reward systems.</strong></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Here’s the great news: Regardless of how popular you are, anyone can learn how to be more socially attuned.</p>
			<h3 class="x05-Head-A">SOCIAL ATTUNEMENT</h3>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Growing up, there were two small letters that sent chills down my spine: PE. Physical Education class was the bane of my awkward, prepubescent existence. The moment I walked into the musky locker room to change, my heart would start to pound. As I surreptitiously tried to change without flashing an inch of skin (sometimes even wearing a second bra as insurance) I would desperately search for any excuse to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_263" title="263"/>escape the daily drills and dodgeball games. Paper cut? Haircut? Apocalypse? I tried them all.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Looking back, I realize I liked playing outside. What I really dreaded was the moment my coach said, “Line up, let’s pick teams!”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Inevitably, the two jockiest kids were assigned as team captains, and then I spent an agonizing few minutes watching them go through my entire class before picking me or my fellow nonathletically inclined buddy, Smelly Matthew. Then one day, my elementary school social life changed. Our coach decided to allow the new girl to be team captain. She had just transferred from a nearby school and didn’t know anyone. In one of the greatest moments in PE history, she picked me <em>first</em>!</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">I was so excited that I ran over to her and then held her hand while she picked the rest of our team. I think we lost in soccer that day, but I was on top of the world. After the game I asked her why she picked me. And then she said one of the greatest things anyone has ever said to me, “I wanted to get to know you.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">As humans, we so desperately want to be known. We want to feel like people get us, like we have someone on our side, like a group wants to have us as a member. <strong>Making people feel this way is called attunement—and it is one of the most underutilized social skills.</strong></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">When we attune, we are more receptive to and more aware of those around us. Attunement is also about acclimatizing or harmonizing with the people we are with. This is the final hack we will learn:</p>
			<p class="x06-Extract-A-First">HACK #14: Attunement</p>
			<p class="x06-Extract-A-Last">Turn people on by making them feel wanted, liked, and known.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">We are often so wrapped up in our own thoughts, schedules, and agendas that we forget to tune into other people’s feelings, needs, and values.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><strong>Special Note:</strong> This is the <em>only</em> hack that should be wielded selectively. It is one of the most powerful tools for connection and should therefore be used only with those whom you truly want to build a deep connection with.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Here’s how attunement works.</p>
			<p class="x06-Epigraph">The world is full of obvious things which nobody by any chance ever observes.</p>
			<p class="x06-Epigraph-Source">—Sherlock Holmes</p>
			<h4 class="x05-Head-B"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_264" title="264"/>#1: Reciprocity</h4>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Stanford researcher Van Sloan studied the social skills of 2,437 high school students across counties in Northern California.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber127" id="SuperscriptNumber127"><sup class="endnote">4</sup></a> He wanted to know which social skills predicted likability as measured by their peers.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">First—and not all that unexpectedly—he found that likable students tended to be more optimistic and upbeat, and had higher self-reported levels of general happiness. But then the results get a bit more interesting: He found that <strong>the most likable students also </strong><span class="BOLD_ITAL">liked </span><strong>the most other people.</strong> Popular students showed their “liking” for others through higher levels of friendliness and smiling. “For females, number of smiles per day was two times more significant to their popularity than physical attractiveness,” wrote Van Sloan.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber128" id="SuperscriptNumber128"><sup class="endnote">5</sup></a> The more a student smiled at their classmates, the more their classmates smiled back at them. This made them <em>feel liked</em>, which made them like that student even more. <strong>We are more inclined to enjoy being with people who visibly enjoy being with us.</strong></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">In social psychology, this is called the reciprocity effect.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber129" id="SuperscriptNumber129"><sup class="endnote">6</sup></a> We like people who like us. We also feel the need to give back the kind of treatment we receive. So if someone smiles at us, we smile back. If someone asks us questions, we feel the need to ask questions back. If someone shares a vulnerability, we feel the need to share a vulnerability back. Every hack you have learned in this book so far was to engage the reciprocity effect.</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-First"><strong>Hack #1: The Social Game Plan:</strong> When you say no to survive situations and embrace thrive situations, you encourage people to also interact in a way that works for them.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted"><strong>Hack #2: The Triple Threat:</strong> When you show up with trusting, confident body language, you inspire the people you are with to be more trusting and confident.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted"><strong>Hack #3: Conversational Sparks:</strong> When you break social scripts with conversation sparks, you engage your partner’s need to respond in kind—with more interesting, exciting tidbits.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted"><strong>Hack #4: Highlighter:</strong> When you highlight people’s strengths, you not only bring out the best in them, you also encourage them to see the best in you.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted"><strong>Hack #5: Thread Theory:</strong> As you search for threads of similarities, you inspire people to hop on the “me too” bandwagon.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted"><strong>Hack #6: The Decoder:</strong> As you tap into and respond to people’s <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_265" title="265"/>true emotions, they are more incentivized to be direct and learn about yours.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted"><strong>Hack #7: Speed-Read: </strong>When you respect someone’s true personality orientation, you show how you would like to be treated.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted"><strong>Hack #8: The Appreciation Matrix:</strong> Finding the energy to appreciate someone on their terms teaches them how to truly care about someone—so they can return it to you in kind.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted"><strong>Hack #9: Primary Value: </strong>When you show someone you value them, they are more inclined to respect your primary value.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted"><strong>Hack #10: The Story Stack:</strong> The more great, witty, clever stories you share, the more people will want to tell you theirs.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted"><strong>Hack #11: Own It!: </strong>The more you empower others, the more they will see you as a leader.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted"><strong>Hack #12: The Franklin Effect: </strong>The more vulnerable you are, the more vulnerable people will be with you.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted"><strong>Hack #13: The NUT Job: </strong>Your calm and direct communication both calms the people you are with and shows them how to direct communication back to you.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Last"><strong>Hack #14: Attunement:</strong> The more you show you are interested in someone, the more interested they will be in you.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Here is the key to being popular: Like more people. When you are with someone you enjoy, consciously engage the reciprocity effect:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-First">Start and end phone calls with “I’m so happy you called!”</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Start and end e-mails with “I’m so glad you e-mailed me!”</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Start and end interactions with “I so enjoyed spending time with you!”</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Invite people to sit with you during lunch, and at parties and conferences.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">When people join your group, table, or meeting, make them feel welcome.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Last">As people leave your group, table, or meeting, thank them and tell them you appreciate their time.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><strong>Duh:</strong> I hope it goes without saying that you should do this only with people you actually like and are grateful for. Attunement should always be authentic.</p>
			<h4 class="x05-Head-B"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_266" title="266"/>#2: Belonging</h4>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">TV mogul and entrepreneur Oprah Winfrey has interviewed thousands of people in her years as a TV host. What has she learned from all of these experiences?</p>
			<p class="x06-Extract-1P">There’s one desire we all share: We want to feel valued. Whether you’re a mother in Topeka or a businesswoman in Philadelphia, each of us, at our core, longs to be loved, needed, understood, affirmed—to have intimate connections that leave us feeling more alive and human.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber130" id="SuperscriptNumber130"><sup class="endnote">7</sup></a></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The greatest gift we can give the people we encounter is to help them feel accepted for who they are. When my elementary school friend picked me to be on her team, it was one of the first times I felt accepted. When she wanted to get to know me, I finally felt like I was being heard. And when we finally became best friends and sat together every day at lunch, I finally felt I belonged.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Why is belonging so important? It’s hard to talk about people without mentioning Abraham Maslow’s classic hierarchy of needs. Maslow theorized that all people have five basic needs that must be met in order to thrive.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber131" id="SuperscriptNumber131"><sup class="endnote">8</sup></a> They are:</p>
			<div class="w100">
				<img alt="" class="w100" id="image_pageMap_266" src="../image/100_Maslows_Hierarchy.jpg"/>
			</div>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_267" title="267"/>After our basic food and shelter requirements, our needs become dependent on nourishment from our relationships. If we truly care about people, we can <em>attune</em> to them by helping them with their needs for the top three areas:</p>
			<p class="x07-List-Head"><strong>Love/Belonging:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Searching for and capitalizing on commonalities that show them you are an ally (Hack #5)</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Getting to know their personality traits and respecting the way they want to interact (Hack #7)</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Discovering and speaking to their appreciation language (Hack #8)</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="x07-List-Head"><strong>Esteem:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Asking them meaningful conversation sparkers about who they are and what they are passionate about (Hack #3)</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Having high expectations and finding the best in people (Hack #4)</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Seeking to decode their true emotions and encouraging honest interactions (Hack #6)</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Last">Being vulnerable and encouraging them to be honest about their fears and worries (Hack #12)</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="x07-List-Head"><strong>Self-Actualization:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Finding their primary value and helping them realize it (Hack #9)</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Empowering them to customize their ideas and actions and giving them purpose with why (Hack #11)</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Last">Finding the source of their difficult behavior and helping them solve problems, instead of judging them (Hack #13)</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">As you improve your social skills, you also help the people you care about to meet their needs.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><strong>Special Note:</strong> Do you feel like you belong? Do you have people who make you feel accepted, heard, and valued? If not, there is a whole community of people just waiting to meet you. Since starting the Science of People, I have made lifelong friends who geek out on people science, love trying out new social experiments, and embrace the upside of awkward at our “Anti-Networking” events.

			<h4 class="x05-Head-B"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_268" title="268"/>#3: Curiosity</h4>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Dan Ariely turned a painful, traumatic experience into a learning opportunity. Instead of being paralyzed by the memories of ripping bandages, he got curious about them. His desire to learn more led him to major breakthrough discoveries about pain that have helped thousands of patients, doctors, and nurses around the world. Curiosity cured.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">If you’re like me, you might have your own painful social experiences. Maybe you were bullied in school. Perhaps even today you feel excluded by peers.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Researchers at UCLA found that physical pain and social rejection activate the same parts of the brain.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber132" id="SuperscriptNumber132"><sup class="endnote">9</sup></a> In other words, when we are rejected, it feels like we are physically hurt.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">We asked people on Twitter what would hurt more: a broken arm or being broken up with? Only 24 percent of people said a broken arm, while 76 percent of people said being broken up with would hurt more. So how do we protect against the pain of social rejection? I believe curiosity is a cure-all—and a great engagement technique.</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-First">When you are curious about the people you are with, it is easier to come up with conversation sparkers.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">When you are curious about someone’s motivations, it is easier to decode their personality matrix.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Last">When you are curious about your own interactions, you can find patterns to help you get better next time.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Every single interaction is an opportunity to understand more about yourself and the people you are with. <strong>Being curious about someone is one of the best ways to show you like them.</strong></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">My favorite way to get curious is to set up my own mini–social experiments. Now it’s your turn to put a personal spin on the human behavior hacks I taught you.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Here are some mini-experiment ideas:</p>
			<ul>

			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">At the very end of one of my phone calls with Dan Ariely, I asked him what advice he would give to people wanting to have more captivating interactions. He told me this:</p>
			<p class="x06-Extract-1P">From time to time I sit next to people on a plane or at a conference and they want to talk. Even if I am not in the mood, I know that if I want to have a good discussion, it is up to me. I can’t blame people for not being interesting or not being good to interact with. I take full responsibility for my interest. Even if I am different from someone, I try to learn from them. Even if I am not interested in something, I try to engage in a new way. I believe we are responsible for having captivating conversations, interactions, and relationships.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber133" id="SuperscriptNumber133"><sup class="endnote">10</sup></a></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><strong>You are in charge of how you want to interact.</strong> You have the power to be captivating or not. We are the only ones who can level up our relationships—so let’s do it!</p>

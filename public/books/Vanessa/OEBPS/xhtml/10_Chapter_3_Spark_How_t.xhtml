			<p class="x03-CO-Body-Text"><span class="_idGenDropcap-1">I</span>n the heart of Bogotá, there are treasures. And Jeffer Carrillo Toscano is our treasure hunter. A small group of us diligently follow him as he weaves through the small cobblestone alleys that make up La Candelaria—one of the oldest neighborhoods in Colombia.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Keep your eyes peeled,” he says, pointing to the tops of Spanish colonial houses and crumbling baroque balconies, “they could be anywhere.” We climb up a set of narrow stairs, barely disturbing a family of napping kittens and stumble upon our first find. What are we looking for? Graffiti.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Nestled between two boarded windows is one of the most beautiful pieces of art I have ever seen. An indigenous woman looks up at the sky as if in prayer or search of rain. It takes my breath away.</p>
			<div class="w80c">
				<img alt="" class="w100" id="image_pageMap_52" src="../image/37_Bogota_graffiti.jpg"/>
			</div>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_53" title="53"/>Street after street, Jeffer points out drawings I never would have noticed before—a portrait on the side of a drainpipe, a mushroom on the corner of an art deco door, a tiny hummingbird next to a patio. As he walks and talks he is constantly surveying the group for interest. He notes when and where people take pictures, who says “Ooohh!” and who looks bored.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">In between streets he plays a memory game and tags each person’s name to where they are from—by the end he has all twenty-six names memorized. Then he asks each of us for our story. He wants to know what brings each person to his graffiti tour—not exactly the typical choice for a tourist.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">One by one he finds something relevant for each person on the tour. One woman works at an international nonprofit to preserve the rain forests of South America. To her delight, he brings her to a large mural depicting the Colombian rain forest.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jeffer then learns one of our group members is an American journalist. He weaves around the streets to show him a political graphic on the base of a cement slab. It shows a black-and-white image of Edward Snowden with the words “Hero or Traitor?” emblazoned in large block letters. The journalist is blown away and begins scribbling away in his notebook for his next story to send home.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Without realizing it, Jeffer is tapping into a fundamental law of human behavior. He creates sparks. His ability to captivate attention has made his Bogotá Graffiti Tour the second-highest-rated activity on TripAdvisor and has been featured in the <em>New York Times</em> as a must-see if you have only thirty-six hours to spend in Bogotá.<span id="footnote-007-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink" href="35_Footnote_5.xhtml">*</a></span></p>
			<h3 class="x05-Head-A">THE DEATH OF SMALL TALK</h3>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">One of the greatest days of my childhood existence could be summed up in two words: Space Mountain. Every summer while I was growing up, my family went to Disneyland. This was the highlight of my year, and my siblings and I counted down the days until we could run through the perfectly manicured, cotton-candy-scented park with abandon.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">There was only one problem. In the beginning, I was not tall enough to go on the best rides—specifically, Space Mountain. I watched as the top of my older brother’s curly hair grazed the ominous height <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_54" title="54"/>requirement line. Then my parents left me to babysit my little sisters as the three of them went down the dark tunnel of excitement without us. I was stuck in the Tiki Room. The thrill of my day came when my youngest sister almost flew out of a spinning teacup because I dared her to not hold on (never, EVER tell Mom).</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">One glorious summer, the top of my pigtail reached that forbidding line. I strapped into my rocket car and gripped the sweaty safety bar. The next two minutes were life defining. Space Mountain blew my mind. All my life I had an inkling I had been missing out, but really I had no idea. The slow, monotonous humps of Dumbo the Flying Elephant did not even come close to comparing to the exhilarating dips and whirls of Space Mountain. The “speed” we reached on the Disneyland Railroad was laughable compared to the daredevil pace of a rocket! That day, my brother and I rode Space Mountain over and over again, and I swore I would never go back to the kiddie rides.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">This is exactly how it works with conversations. For most of our lives, we chitchat on the kiddie ride. Our conversations aren’t memorable because we aren’t very stimulated or excited. Our energy level during most small talk looks something like this:</p>
			<div class="w80c">
				<img alt="" class="w100" id="image_pageMap_54_0" src="../image/38_Small_Talk.jpg"/>
			</div>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">This is small talk. With no high peaks and no interesting hooks, our conversations come and go—we are lucky to remember our partner’s name, let alone what we talked about. I want to introduce the concept of Big Talk.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Big Talk is like Space Mountain. You start with anticipation and roll easily through the conversation, laughing and hitting highs as it gets better and better. Our energy level looks like this:</p>
			<div class="w80c">
				<img alt="" class="w100" id="image_pageMap_55_1" src="../image/39_Big_Talk.jpg"/>
			</div>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_55" title="55"/>Like a great roller coaster, great conversations leave you feeling both exhilarated and hoping you’ll never have to experience small talk again.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Now, the death of small talk requires some effort. Like any good people hack, Big Talk means skirting conversational norms, challenging chitchat status quo, and shirking social scripts. Roller coasters command a little extra height and so does Big Talk.</p>
			<h3 class="x05-Head-A">THE SCIENCE OF SPARKS</h3>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">The reason why we love roller coasters is because of the peaks. The top of each summit gives us a rush as we await and enjoy the glee of the ride. Big Talk is marked by the same kind of emotional peaks. The best conversations have specific jolts of energy and excitement—I call these star moments “sparks.”</p>
			<div class="w80c">
				<img alt="" class="w100" id="image_pageMap_55" src="../image/40_Sparks.jpg"/>

			<p class="x06-Extract-A-First"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_56" title="56"/>HACK #3: Conversational Sparks</p>
			<p class="x06-Extract-A-Last">Use unique talking points to create pleasurable and memorable conversations.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Big Talk has tons of sparks—lots of little bursts of pleasure that we remember. Have you ever had a great conversation with someone? Afterward, did you savor it—replaying the high points, rolling around the humorous moments over and over again in your head? This is because conversational sparks make us feel good.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">In the brain, sparks are marked by dopamine.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber24" id="SuperscriptNumber24"><sup class="endnote">1</sup></a> Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that is released in the amygdala when we feel pleasure. When we get a birthday gift, praise from our boss, or a reward, dopamine floods our brain. Think about the joy you get when you walk into a store and the clerk tells you, “Free samples!” That feeling of excitement is pure dopamine.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Here’s what’s interesting about dopamine: It helps your memory. Molecular biologist Dr. John Medina likens dopamine to a mental marker. He says, “Dopamine greatly aids memory and information processing. You can think of it like a Post-it note that reads ‘Remember this!’ Getting one’s brain to put a chemical Post-it note on a given piece of information means that information is going to be more robustly processed.”<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber25" id="SuperscriptNumber25"><sup class="endnote">2</sup></a> In other words, being memorable boils down to inducing chemical pleasure.<strong> When you produce dopamine during a conversation, you not only give your partner more enjoyment, you are also assigned more significance, which increases your memorability.</strong></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The question is: How do you spark dopamine during a conversation? I would love for you to keep little presents in your pockets like a birthday party magician, but that isn’t very practical—and business suits don’t have particularly roomy pockets. Instead, you can produce pleasure verbally. Presents don’t come only in colorfully wrapped packages. Rewards don’t need to have a dollar sign. Gratification doesn’t just come from physically feeling good.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">There are three ways to hack your conversations to make them both more pleasurable and more memorable. Let’s turn your small talk into Big Talk.</p>
			<h4 class="x05-Head-B">Step #1: Conversation Sparkers</h4>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">One day I was sitting in the green room of a morning news show, nervously awaiting my segment. All of a sudden, in walked one of my favorite <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_57" title="57"/>writers—Elizabeth Gilbert, author of <em>Eat Pray Love</em> and <em>Big Magic</em>. I was stunned and immediately began racking my brain for something interesting to say. I was dying to talk to her, but had no idea what would pique her interest. What does one say to a literary icon, a bestselling author, and a personal hero? Should I ask about her book? No, too obvious. Should I ask where she is from? No, too bland. Should I just blurt out how much I love her books? No, too suck-uppy.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Before I could work up my nerve, the other guest in the green room smiled at both of us and said, “Do you like soup?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Okay, this is one conversation starter I would never have come up with on my own. But I was grateful. I stared at the other guest, wide-eyed at her courage, and held my breath—how on earth would Ms. Gilbert react? To my amazement, Elizabeth Gilbert (“Call me Liz,” she clarified immediately) clapped her hands and began telling us about her favorite winter soup recipes. We reminisced about Grandma-made stews and laughed about the perils of eating healthy while traveling. Who would have thought that a soup conversation starter would spark such a lively and fun discussion?</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">I found out later that the other guest was a chef publishing a soup cookbook and Liz was on one of her West Coast book tours. I was doing a segment on the science of friendship—and we all had thirty minutes to kill before we went live on air. All we needed was a spark.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Most conversations go something like this:</p>
			<p class="x06-Dialogue-First">What do you do?</p>
			<p class="x06-Dialogue">Oh, that’s nice. Where are you from?</p>
			<p class="x06-Dialogue">Mmm, never been there. So, what brings you here?</p>
			<p class="x06-Dialogue-Last">Good, good. Well, I’m going to get another drink . . .</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Boring! This conversation is the equivalent of sitting on a kiddie ride. There is almost no emotional stimulation, no sparks, no highs, just a slow roll to an anticlimactic ending where you desperately need hand sanitizer. It’s time to step up to Space Mountain.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">I get it—sometimes we’re lazy or plain afraid of tackling new topics. But what’s the point of following nearly identical social scripts every time you talk to someone? What’s the point of trying to talk to a new client if it’s so boring that they won’t remember it anyway? What’s the point of interacting on autopilot?</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_58" title="58"/>Big Talk requires asking fresh questions that cause conversational sparks. I call these conversation “sparkers” in lieu of conversation “starters.” They ignite new ideas, introduce topics we have never thought about, and stimulate in-depth discussions.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Why do we get pleasure from novelty?</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Neurobiologists Dr. Nico Bunzeck and Dr. Emrah Düzel conducted a study they called “The Oddball Experiments.”<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber26" id="SuperscriptNumber26"><sup class="endnote">3</sup></a> In this test, experimenters showed participants a series of images while scanning their brains in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) machine. Most of the images depicted the same face and the same scene. However, participants were intermittently shown a series of “oddball” images.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The researchers measured blood flow to different areas of the brain as participants observed each image. They found that oddball images activate our brain’s “novelty center” (the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area). Here’s why novelty matters:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-First"><strong>Memory and Learning:</strong> The oddball images activated the area influenced by the hippocampus, which is the brain’s learning and memory center. Novelty makes our brain perk up, pay attention, and process the conversation better. Want people to remember <em>your</em> name? Spark excitement and novelty.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted"><strong>Pleasure:</strong> This novelty center is linked to our dopamine pathways in the amygdala—the almond-shaped bundle of neurons near the base of the brain. New ideas and topics give us a nice bump of dopamine in this region, which makes us feel great.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Last"><strong>Interest:</strong> Dopamine also encourages us to seek even more rewards. In other words, a little bit of fresh conversation encourages both people to want to go deeper and explore more. Dr. Düzel explains, “When we see something new, we see it has a potential for rewarding us in some way. This potential that lies in new things motivates us to explore our environment for rewards.”<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber27" id="SuperscriptNumber27"><sup class="endnote">4</sup></a></li>
			</ul>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><strong>If we abandon social scripts and push ourselves to use conversational sparks, we are more likely to enjoy our interactions and remember what was actually said.</strong></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">In 2016, we partnered with the organizations Mercy Corps, Society for Information Management, and Girls Inc. to run a set of speed networking <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_59" title="59"/>experiments. In these experiments, we randomly partnered over three hundred participants to test conversation starters. At each chair, participants have seven slips of paper waiting for them. Each card has a different conversation starter and a space for a rating.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Once everyone is seated, we start the speed networking rounds. Each conversation starter gets one three-minute round. At the end of three minutes, we ring a bell and each participant rates the quality of the conversation produced—1 for boring, 5 for stellar. Here are the seven rounds. Can you guess which three were rated the highest?</p>
			<p class="x07-List-Unnumbered-First">___ What’s your story?</p>
			<p class="x07-List-Unnumbered">___ How are you?</p>
			<p class="x07-List-Unnumbered">___ What was the highlight of your day?</p>
			<p class="x07-List-Unnumbered">___ What do you do?</p>
			<p class="x07-List-Unnumbered">___ Have anything exciting coming up in your life?</p>
			<p class="x07-List-Unnumbered">___ What brings you here?</p>
			<p class="x07-List-Unnumbered-Last">___ What personal passion project are you working on?</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">There were clear winners. Here they are in order of highest rank to lowest:</p>
			<ol>
				<li class="x07-List-Numbered-1-First" value="1">What was the highlight of your day?</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Numbered-1">What personal passion project are you working on?</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Numbered-1">Have anything exciting coming up in your life?</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Numbered-1">What’s your story?</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Numbered-1">What brings you here?</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Numbered-1">What do you do?</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Numbered-1-Last">How are you?</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Sometimes, we also do a “Grab Bag” round where we have people choose any of the seven previous conversation starters to ask and write down which one they used. The most popular choices for Grab Bag are “What personal passion project are you working on?” and “What’s your story?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The problem is that the conversation starters we most often use—“What do you do?” and “How are you?”—are rated as the most boring. So why do we keep on using them?</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_60" title="60"/>We stick to social scripts out of habit. We use the same dull conversation starters over and over again because they are in our comfort zone. But you know what? Nothing spark-worthy ever happens in your comfort zone. <strong>If you keep using social scripts, you will be stuck in small talk forever.</strong></p>

			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><strong><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_61" title="61"/>Bonus:</strong> Sometimes, if I am nervous about asking a conversation sparker, I will tell people, “I’m on a small-talk diet<strong>,</strong> can I ask you a new conversation sparker I’m trying out?” This question in itself releases dopamine! I <em>always</em> get a positive response when I preface a question this way—in fact, people tend to lean in, raise their eyebrows curiously, and exclaim something like, “Yes please! How interesting!”</p>
			<h4 class="x05-Head-B">Step #2: Push Hot Buttons</h4>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">One of the ways you can create conversational high points is by looking for someone’s hot-button issues. This is a topic, hobby, or activity that lights someone up. You know you have pushed a hot button when the other person:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-First">Begins nodding their head up and down as if to say, “Yes!”</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Murmurs in agreement with “Mmm-hmm”</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Leans in to hear more</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Writes back a longer e-mail than usual</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Exclaims in surprise with “Huh!” or “Wow!”</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_62" title="62"/>Tells you, “Fascinating!” “Interesting,” or “Tell me more!”</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Raises their eyebrows—this is the universal signal of curiosity</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Says, “Ooohh” or “Aahh”</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Last">Smiles and uses more animated gestures</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">When any of these engagement cues happen, you know that you have just sparked some dopamine and pushed a hot button.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">This is what Jeffer Carrillo Toscano is looking for on his tours. He points things out or tells a story and looks to see if he has sparked any interest. If so, he goes into more detail.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">You can find hot-button issues by using sparkers that look for specific interests. In the set of studies by OkCupid I discussed earlier, their data scientists found that bringing up specific interests in direct messages also proved to be the most effective. Generic is boring. The more specific you can be, the more likely you are to find a hot button.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The messages that were replied to the most contained words such as “metal,” “vegetarian,” and “zombie.” Why? One of these might be a hot button, but even if they aren’t, you at least have something to talk about.</p>

			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_63" title="63"/>You can search for hot buttons in conversation. I bolded the potential hot buttons in these questions:</p>

				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">You asked for <strong>Argentinian wine</strong>—are you a wine aficionado?</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">I noticed that your purse is <strong>handwoven</strong>—did you make it?</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">I was curious about your accent—are you <strong>from</strong> here?</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">I was just looking at your <strong>bookshelf</strong>—you have great taste in reading materials!</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Your name is beautiful—is it a <strong>family</strong> name?</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Last">I saw you posted some great pictures of your <strong>new dog</strong> on Facebook—what made you decide to get a dog?</li>

			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_64" title="64"/>The moment someone lights up, you know you have just pushed a hot button.

				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-First"><strong>Trial 1:</strong> Can you spare any change?</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted"><strong>Trial 2:</strong> Can you spare a quarter?</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Last"><strong>Trial 3:</strong> Can you spare thirty-seven cents?</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Can you guess which question did best? Yup, the third trial got the most people to say yes.</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-First"><strong>Trial 1:</strong> Can you spare any change? (44 percent of people complied)</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted"><strong>Trial 2:</strong> Can you spare a quarter? (64 percent of people complied)</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Last"><strong>Trial 3:</strong> Can you spare 37 cents? <strong>(75 percent of people complied)</strong></li>
			</ul>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The researchers found that slightly unusual or surprising requests pique the most interest.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber30" id="SuperscriptNumber30"><sup class="endnote">7</sup></a> It’s like coffee for the brain. Unique questions, unexpected stories, and uncommon occurrences keep us alert in conversation. <strong>In other words, being different wakes people up.</strong></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">When you try to be the same as everyone else, it’s boring. When you try to fit into a mold, you become forgettable. When you try to be “normal,” you become dull. Just be yourself, because no one is like you. If you’re a little weird, own it. The right people will like you for it.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">This is not always easy. It’s hard to own being a little unique. Before I started using unique sparks in my conversations, I began experimenting with it on my website. For example, most websites ask you to “Click here!” or “Sign up here” or “Visit this link,” so I decided to try something unique. I put a button on my sidebar that says, “Do Not Click Here.”</p>
			<div class="w50c">
				<img alt="" class="w100" src="../image/5.jpg"/>
			</div>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_65" title="65"/>It is one of the most visited pages on my website simply because it says something different. By the way, I reward clickers of that button with a video of cute baby animals.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Once I got a little more brave, I started to wonder if I could add conversational sparks to my elevator pitch to spice it up a little. My old pitch:</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I’m a writer.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Boring! This is the equivalent of a panhandler asking for some change—you hear it, but it doesn’t really register. We have heard it before and we, sadly, pass right by. I decided to do my own version of the panhandling experiment. I came up with three versions of what I do and printed up business cards with a different e-mail address for each one.</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-First">I’m a writer.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">I write about people.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Last">I’m a professional people watcher.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Over the next few weeks when someone would ask, “What do you do?” I would try out a version and then give them the corresponding card <em>if they asked for it. </em>I began to track not only which cards I passed out the most, but also which e-mails got the highest contact rate.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">I shouldn’t have been surprised to learn that “I’m a writer” did not get many card requests, nor did many people follow up with me after events; my “I’m a professional people watcher” elevator pitch got both laughs and card requests. I even began experimenting with putting unique images and content on my business card and found that those cards always got better feedback and won me more clients:</p>
			<div class="w80c">
				<img alt="" class="w100" id="image_pageMap_65" src="../image/45_Business_card_VVE_new1.jpg"/>
			</div>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_66" title="66"/>Since conversational sparks were working for my pitches, I wondered if they might also work for others. One of my favorite TV shows is ABC’s <em>Shark Tank</em>. In this show, entrepreneurs pitch their business ideas to a panel of investors called sharks. I wanted to know if there were pitch patterns. So we decided to run a massive <em>Shark Tank</em> experiment.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">As of January 2016, 495 entrepreneurs have pitched on <em>Shark Tank</em>—253 got deals and 242 did not. What’s the difference? We analyzed each and every one of the 495 pitches and found distinct differences between the successful and unsuccessful entrepreneurs. One that immediately caught our attention was that standout entrepreneurs used conversational sparks and hot buttons in their pitches.<strong> Entrepreneurs who added a unique request, tried something a little different, or added interactivity to their pitch had a much higher likelihood of getting a deal.</strong></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The majority of successful entrepreneurs—63 percent—used a unique pitch method to get a deal. Some entrepreneurs brought on mascots like the one for Mr. Tod’s Pie Factory. Others brought on celebrities like Vincent Pastore from <em>The Sopranos</em> for Brocolli Wad. And the Kisstixx pitchers even made sharks Kevin O’Leary and Barbara Corcoran kiss to try out their lip balm.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">This is a way that entrepreneurs created sparks or high points in their pitches. Sharks hear dozens of pitches every episode, so when an entrepreneur tries something unique, it sparks dopamine for the investors and wakes them up.<span id="footnote-005-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink" href="37_Footnote_7.xhtml">*</a></span></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Conversational sparks add fuel to any interaction. I love to use the element of surprise to pique people’s interest. I frequently hand out lollipops with my business cards that say, “Learn how not to suck.”</p>
			<div class="w80c">
				<img alt="" class="w100" id="image_pageMap_66" src="../image/46_Lollipop.jpg"/>
			</div>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_67" title="67"/>When people visit my office, I offer them hot cocoa instead of coffee. At trade shows, I have a bowl of Pop Rocks at my table instead of mints. In my guest bathroom at home, we have an R2D2 Pez dispenser and a gift book welcoming snoopers to our medicine cabinet. I send people air plants instead of flowers. I hide Easter eggs on my website (these are hidden links that once clicked deliver people to a video of me telling a corny joke).</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Think about how you can energize different areas of your life. This creates tons of dopamine-worthy moments for the people you encounter. Again, this takes a little bravery, but can supercharge your conversations, pitches, meetings, parties, and social media with a little bit of uniqueness. Here are some more ways you can add conversational sparks to your interactions:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-First"><strong>Spice up your job title. </strong>Quicken Loans has a “vice president of miscellaneous stuff” who helps with a little bit of everything. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt calls its receptionists “directors of first impressions” since they are typically the company’s greeters.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted"><strong>Stop posting food pictures and sunsets on Instagram. </strong>Post something people haven’t seen before. New mom and photographer Laura Izumikawa started posting (frickin’ adorable) pictures of her sleeping newborn baby dressed like different celebrities and characters like Jon Snow, Pikachu, and Beyoncé. As of writing she has over 400,000 followers and her account has been featured on the <em>Huffington Post</em>, Buzzfeed, and <em>Inside Edition</em>.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted"><strong>Put a unique quote in your e-mail signature. </strong>Noah Kagan, creator of an e-mail and analytics software, has a funny sign-off on all of his e-mails: “Ps. Y u NO install the free SumoMe.com to get more e-mail subscribers?” The purposeful misspellings and play on a popular meme makes his ask unique and very clickable.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted"><strong>Don’t serve coffee to clients; serve vanilla tea, lemonade, or cake pops. </strong>When I checked into San Diego’s famous L’Auberge Del Mar hotel, I was given a room key and a s’mores cupcake—talk about a welcome gift! My elevator ride and first few hotel moments were sweet bliss.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted"><strong>Stop bringing casserole to potlucks. Whip up a recipe no one has tried before. </strong>Pinterest is a never-ending source of inspiration for rainbow cupcakes, Rice Krispies ice cream, and pickle potato chips.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Last"><strong><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_68" title="68"/>Instead of sending thank-you cards, send thank-you stickers—or pins, or lollipops, or popcorn. </strong>At the Be Sage wedding conference, they gave attendees coloring books and pencils to use during sessions and on the plane ride home. People loved them and shared tons of pictures of their creations on social media with the conference’s hashtag.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Don’t be afraid to try out a new joke, tell a silly story, or ask a nontypical conversation sparker. You’ll spice up your night, add flair to theirs, and have conversations you will never forget.</p>
			<p class="x06-Epigraph">It is not your customer’s job to remember you. It is your obligation and responsibility to make sure they don’t have the chance to forget you.</p>
			<p class="x06-Epigraph-Source">—Patricia Fripp</p>
			<h4 class="x05-Head-B">Bonus: Say My Name</h4>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">You’ve probably heard that it’s charming to lightly drop someone’s name in conversation. You, me, everyone else: We love the sound of our own names.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Dennis Carmody and Michael Lewis found that compared to other people’s names, upon hearing our own name we have greater brain activation in the middle frontal and superior temporal cortex—also where the amygdala and hippocampus are located.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber31" id="SuperscriptNumber31"><sup class="endnote">8</sup></a></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">This was one of the reasons why Jeffer hits it off so well with his tour groups right away. He makes a point of quickly memorizing every single person’s name on the tour.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Not good with names? Not anymore. Here is my three-step Name Game that you can do every time you meet someone new:</p>
			<ol>
				<li class="x07-List-Numbered-1-First" value="1"><strong>Meet and Repeat:</strong> As soon as you hear the name, say it out loud back to them. “It’s so nice to meet you, Eliza!” or “Eliza, this is my colleague Jenna.” This jangles the audio part of your memory and allows you to hear the name in your own voice. Plus, you give them a nice hit of dopamine.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Numbered-1"><strong>Spell It Out:</strong> Now we want to give that name a visual hook. Memory expert Dr. Gary Small encourages people to mentally <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_69" title="69"/>spell out the name they are trying to remember.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber32" id="SuperscriptNumber32"><sup class="endnote">9</sup></a> You can also pull up a picture of the name in your head.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Numbered-1"><strong>Associate and Anchor: </strong>Lastly, tie the name to someone else you know with that same name. It can even be a celebrity. This anchors the name to someone else you are familiar with. For example, whenever I meet a Matt, I always seat him at a poker table with all of my other Matt friends.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Numbered-1-Last"><strong>Bonus:</strong> If it is a unique name or a name you have not heard before, tie it to a word that most closely resembles it. For example, I met a Syder (pronounced very similar to “cider”) so I pulled up a mental picture of a steaming glass of cider. He was shocked when I remembered his name at the end of the night.</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">This exercise takes a bit of practice, but is a fun way to gamify names. I highly recommend teaching this Name Game to your friends or colleagues because you can help each other think of anchors when you meet people.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><strong>Insider Tip:</strong> If you totally forget a name, set up a system with the people you are with. Anytime you introduce someone to them first, they should ask for the name. For example, if my husband says, “I would love to introduce you to my wife,” and does not mention the person’s name, it means he does not know it. Then I know to ask, “Lovely to meet you. What was your name?” Easy peasy.</p>
			<h4 class="x05-Head-B">A Safety Net</h4>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Worried you won’t be able to think of a snazzy conversation sparker when the moment comes? Scared you will be caught tongue-tied during your next interaction? Wish you had “someone” to text on an awkward date? Have no fear—Vanessa is here!</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Anytime you don’t know what to say, anytime you’re awkward, anytime you need a little social help, <strong>just text me. Really.</strong><span id="footnote-004-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink" href="38_Footnote_8.xhtml">*</a></span><strong> (Blah, blah, normal text messaging rates apply.)</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-First"><strong>“Tell me what to say”</strong> and I’ll send you a conversation starter.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted"><strong>“Give me a pep talk”</strong> and I’ll send you an encouraging word.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted"><strong><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_70" title="70"/>“Send me a joke”</strong> and I’ll send you a corny joke to make you laugh.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted"><strong>“Send me a tip”</strong> and I’ll send you a social skills tip to help pump you up.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Last"><strong>Bonus:</strong> Want to be daring? Text me: <strong>“Give me a social dare”</strong> and I’ll send you a superfun challenge to try wherever you are!</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="x05-Head-A">FIND YOUR SPARKS</h3>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">If you want to have dazzling conversations, it’s up to you to create sparks. You can remember someone’s name, use conversation sparkers, or push hot buttons to create talking high points. Get out of your own conversational autopilot. Don’t use social scripts, ignite conversational sparks. Stop passively listening and push hot buttons. Hack conversations by creating talking high points. Be more memorable by really remembering the people you meet—from their names to their interests. Ending small talk starts big connections.</p>
			<h3 class="x05-Head-A">CHALLENGES</h3>
			<ol>
				<li class="x07-List-Numbered-1-First-No-Space" value="1">Use one conversation sparker this week and see how it completely changes the interaction.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Numbered-1">Try adding some hot buttons to your pitch, e-mail signature, or next conversation.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Numbered-1">Turn on the TV and find a show you have never seen before. Every time a new character is introduced, try the three-step Name Game. This is a low-stakes and laid-back way to practice.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Numbered-1"><strong>Bonus:</strong> Send me a text to say “hi.” If you’re really brave, ask me for a “social dare.”</li>
			</ol>
			<h3 class="x05-Head-A">CHAPTER REVIEW</h3>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">We don’t like, remember, or enjoy being around boring people. The best way to hack into stimulating conversations and create memorable connections is to ignite conversational sparks. We are attracted to people who give us mental pleasure, who push our hot buttons, keep us mentally alert, and learn our names.</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-First"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_71" title="71"/>Abandon social scripts to change your small talk to Big Talk.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Find topics that turn people on.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Last">Create sparks by using people’s names, asking unique questions, and bringing up novel topics.</li>

			<h2 class="x03-Chapter-Title">HIGHLIGHT</h2>
			<h2 class="x03-Chapter-Subtitle-2L">How to be the most memorable person in the room</h2>
			<p class="x03-CO-Body-Text"><span class="_idGenDropcap-1">M</span>y Vow of Silence lasted for seven days. No talking. No writing. No posting on social media. No responding to e-mail.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">That week was one of the hardest, most introspective, soul-wrenching times of my life. I almost lost my mind.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The whole adventure started the day my kind, honest friend dropped an advice bomb. She gave me one of the toughest pieces of constructive feedback I have ever received: “You are an interrupter.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Horrified, I tried to clarify, “What do you mean? Do you think I interrupt you when you speak?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Gently, she explained, “Yes, and”—another truth grenade—“I’ve heard you do it to others, too.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Boom! Shock. Embarrassment. And then a little self-exploration: I am terrified of awkward silences. I fear that moment when someone finishes a sentence and no one knows what to say next. To prevent these uncomfortable pauses, I got in the habit of interrupting. Worse, I began to preplan my responses while only half listening to the conversation. This is a terrible way to interact—it’s disrespectful, inauthentic, and exhausting for all parties.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">I realized that if I wanted to learn to be a better listener quickly, I should quit talking cold turkey. Enter: Vow of Silence. On August 10, 2014, I took a pledge and alerted all of my readers and colleagues that I would not be talking. I wanted to be in silence until the silence became less scary.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">There was one other hurdle. Even though I couldn’t talk, I still wanted to listen. So instead of hiding out in my house reading, I forced myself to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_73" title="73"/>attend all of my usual meetings, networking events, and dinners like normal, but just listened. This way, I had to be present. I couldn’t think about witty comebacks, funny stories, or follow-ups. My number one goal was simply to listen with my entire brain. I didn’t even allow myself to write—then I still would have been dreaming up clever responses instead of listening. My only allowances were four premade flash cards that I could show to people I encountered. They said:</p>
			<ol>
				<li class="x07-List-Numbered-1-First" value="1">“I’ve taken a Vow of Silence. I’m trying to become a better listener.”</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Numbered-1">“Please tell me about yourself.”</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Numbered-1">“I’m sorry.”</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Numbered-1-Last">“Thank you for allowing my silence.”</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The first day was the hardest. I walked into my first networking event as a sweaty, jittery mess. What if I freaked people out? What would I do in those horrible long pauses of silent disgust? Can you get kicked out of networking events for not networking?</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">I completely panicked when a gentleman introduced himself. But I shakily held up my first card: “I’ve taken a Vow of Silence. I’m trying to become a better listener.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">To my delight and surprise, he laughed and told me how he had once lost his voice to laryngitis in college and it was one of the coolest and craziest experiences of his life. Then he spoke about meeting his wife a few weeks later. Then he shared his hope for his children. Then he asked for my card. I didn’t say a word. I didn’t have to. He just wanted to be listened to.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">As humans, we are desperate to be heard. The biggest thing I learned during my Vow of Silence is that <strong>the best conversations aren’t about what you say, they are about what you hear</strong>. I made better business connections during my <em>silent</em> week than during the fast-paced industry conference I went to the week before. One businesswoman even e-mailed me the day after my Vow of Silence and said:</p>
			<p class="x06-Extract-1P">Hey Vanessa! I have been thinking so much about our conversation last night. I just joined your body language course and can’t wait to start it. I would love to take you out to coffee in the next few weeks if you are free.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_74" title="74"/>This e-mail boggled my mind! I hadn’t said a single word, but somehow our “conversation” was so memorable that it brought me business. Why?</p>
			<h3 class="x05-Head-A">SILENCE SCIENCE</h3>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">As much as we hate to admit it, we love to talk about ourselves. In fact, humans spend 30 to 40 percent of their verbal output solely dedicated to self-disclosure. This number balloons to 80 percent on social media sites like Twitter and Facebook.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Harvard neuroscientists Diana Tamir and Jason Mitchell found that something changes in our brain when we talk about ourselves. Activity increases in the brain regions that form the mesolimbic dopamine system. Keyword: dopamine.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber33" id="SuperscriptNumber33"><sup class="endnote">1</sup></a> <strong>Talking about ourselves gives us pleasure.</strong></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">In one experiment, participants were even willing to forgo money to disclose more information about themselves. Yup—people will pay for the privilege to express their opinions.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">This is the science behind the famous Dale Carnegie phrase “To be interesting, be interested”<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber34" id="SuperscriptNumber34"><sup class="endnote">2</sup></a> and why my Vow of Silence worked so well. When you are interested, when you listen, when you let people talk, they feel pleasure.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Before my Vow of Silence, my mind was always spinning trying to think of what I was going to say next. I couldn’t really process what people were saying because I was too busy trying to think of witty jokes, dazzling stories, and clever responses. This was a terrible way to interact. I was both distracted and turning people off by my distractedness. Then, to my great surprise, my silence won me more friends than my overeagerness ever had. Does this mean we should all go around being silent during our interactions? Definitely no. Being interested is only the first piece of the puzzle.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Step One: When you ask dopamine-worthy conversation sparkers and listen to people’s responses, pleasure is produced. Success! BUT it’s what you do next that counts.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Step Two: How do you honor what they say? What are you listening for? How do you respond to their self-disclosure? A great interaction is not one-sided.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Here’s the thing: Being quiet didn’t just help me learn how to avoid interrupting, it also taught me a new way of listening.</p>
			<p class="x06-Epigraph"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_75" title="75"/>I never learned anything while I was talking.</p>

			<h3 class="x05-Head-A">SILENT SLOAN</h3>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">When Alfred P. Sloan took the reins as vice president of operations at General Motors, the company was struggling. In 1920, General Motors accounted for only a 12 percent share of car sales in the country. Sloan dreamed bigger. He decided the best way to tackle his industry competitors—namely the Ford motorcar—would be to go directly to his dealers to improve sales. Sloan began to visit each and every dealership personally and listen to the salesmen’s ideas. Sloan’s unique style was unheard of at this time—borderline heretical. As reported by the <em>New York Times:</em></p>
			<p class="x06-Extract-1P">“It may surprise you to know,” he said at the time, “that I have personally visited, with many of my associates, practically every city in the United States, from the Atlantic to the Pacific and from Canada to Mexico. On these trips I visit from 5 to 10 dealers a day. I meet them in their own places of business, talk with them across their own desks and solicit from them suggestions and criticisms as to their relations with the corporation.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">When meeting with dealers, Sloan didn’t try to win them over or convince them of his ideas. He once said, “I prefer to appeal to the intelligence of a man rather than attempt to exercise authority over him.” He was nicknamed Silent Sloan because “When he listened, it was with the extra intentness of the deaf.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Sloan remained at the helm of General Motors until 1956. During his tenure, he spearheaded major advances in automotive technology including four-wheel brakes, ethyl gasoline, crankcase ventilation, and knee-action front springs. By the time he left in 1956, General Motors was one of the world’s most successful companies and had claimed over 52 percent of market share (a big leap from the 12 percent when Sloan first started).<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber35" id="SuperscriptNumber35"><sup class="endnote">3</sup></a></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Personal friend of Sloan and leading business author Peter F. Drucker credits Sloan’s success not to a fearless vision or to ruthless tactics but to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_76" title="76"/>a listening-driven management style. How did Sloan hack the art of listening? Here’s how he worked:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-First">Sloan spent six days a week in meetings, three with formal agendas and three to address problems as they arose.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Other than stating each meeting’s initial purpose, Sloan attended each meeting in silence. He almost never took notes or spoke except to clarify something with a question. According to Drucker, he ended each meeting with a brief pointed summary and thanks.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Last">Following each meeting, Sloan would pick one executive to be accountable and composed a short memo with a summary of what was said, next steps, work assignments, and a specific deadline. A copy of the memo was sent to everyone in the meeting.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber36" id="SuperscriptNumber36"><sup class="endnote">4</sup></a></li>
			</ul>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Sloan overturned conventional wisdom on what effective leadership looked like. In 1931, MIT created the first university program for executives called Sloan Fellows. And then the MIT Sloan School of Management was founded in 1950.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">For three decades, Silent Sloan<strong> led with what he heard, not with what he said.</strong> He listened with intent and then followed up with action. I call this hack being a highlighter.</p>
			<p class="x06-Epigraph">You bring out the best in yourself by looking for the best in others.</p>
			<p class="x06-Epigraph-Source">—Gene Bedley, National Educator of the Year</p>
			<h3 class="x05-Head-A">SKILL #1: BE A HIGHLIGHTER</h3>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">I have a moderate obsession with office supplies. Nothing gets me going like a fresh pack of snazzy pens, a bunch of little notebooks, and a colorful array of sticky tabs. I remember inheriting my first bright yellow highlighter from my older brother—and by inherited, I do mean stolen from his backpack.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">It was such a game changer! That little stick of brightness helped me learn faster, remember more and emphasize important points. The best communicators do the exact same thing—they serve as conversational <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_77" title="77"/>highlighters. They listen to learn more about a person, to remember what was said and then find the important points to act upon.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">So far, you’ve designed your Social Game Plan, leveraged the Triple Threat, and sparked conversation. Now what? It’s time to hack the art—and science—of listening. You can do this by being a highlighter:</p>
			<p class="x06-Extract-A-First">HACK #4: Highlighter</p>
			<p class="x06-Extract-A-Last">Bring out the best in people by highlighting their strengths.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">When you know what to listen for, you know exactly how to respond. Highlighting is also a way of practicing more refreshing and honest interactions. Highlighting is not about sugarcoating, it’s not about brownnosing, and it’s not about sucking up. It’s about honoring what you truly find noteworthy and getting real conversations started.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Emily McDowell has made an entire business out of speaking truth by highlighting people.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber37" id="SuperscriptNumber37"><sup class="endnote">5</sup></a> And, it happened by accident. In 2012, Emily had an idea for a different kind of Valentine’s Day card. She wanted to help the people on Valentine’s Day who are dating but not officially in a relationship.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">So she printed up one hundred copies of this card at a local printer and put it up on Etsy in late January 2013. She called it “The Awkward Dating Card.”</p>
			<div class="w80c">
				<img alt="" class="w100" id="image_pageMap_77" src="../image/47_Valentines_Day_Card.jpg"/>
			</div>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_78" title="78"/>Talk about a conversation sparker! Her card’s raw honesty and humor took the Internet by storm. Three months later, she got an order from Urban Outfitters for 96,000 cards. Emily started creating more honest posters, pins, tote bags, and paper products that help highlight anyone who receives them.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She has ridiculously candid birthday cards that say, “Thinking about you is like remembering I have ice cream in the freezer.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">You can get notepads that are “Everyday Achievement Awards” where friends or colleagues can fill in the blanks to highlight a recent task: “Is hereby issued to <span class="line">                  </span> for the modest yet mighty task of <span class="line">                  </span>. We honor your victory.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">I was turned on to Emily’s amazing highlighting approach when someone handed me a card that said, “I notice how awesome you are.” It made my day! I then got myself a pack of her cards to hand out that say, “I love the shit out of you” and “You don’t suck.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Emily’s cards are powerful because they give both compliments and truth. Anyone can be a Hallmark card—doling out bland flattery and boring cliches. But highlighting is about more than just giving regular praise. Like Emily McDowell’s cards, it is about truly expecting the best from people and helping everyone in your life perform, act, and show up as the best, most honest version of themselves.</p>
			<h4 class="x05-Head-B">The Pygmalion Effect</h4>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">There is a famous Greek myth about the sculptor Pygmalion. According to legend, Pygmalion used a large piece of ivory to carve his vision of the ideal woman. His statue was so beautiful and realistic that he fell in love with it. Embarrassed and ashamed to admit his desires, Pygmalion made offerings to the love goddess Aphrodite. At her altar, he secretly prayed to meet a woman who would be “the living likeness of my ivory girl.”<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber38" id="SuperscriptNumber38"><sup class="endnote">6</sup></a></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">When Pygmalion got back to his studio, he planted a soft kiss on the statue. To his surprise, he found the ivory lips warm. When he kissed her again, the statue came to life. Pygmalion then married the woman of his own creation.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The Pygmalion myth is about the self-fulfilling power of expectation. Pygmalion created a blueprint of what he wanted and then it came to life. In other words, <strong>great expectations are met with greatness.</strong> Psychologists have found that this idea is no myth. This phenomenon is called the Pygmalion effect.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_79" title="79"/>When voters are told they are more “politically active” than their peers (even if they were actually chosen at random), they have a 15 percent higher turnout rate than the control group.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber39" id="SuperscriptNumber39"><sup class="endnote">7</sup></a></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">When donors are told that they are above-average givers (even if they are not), they in turn donate more to become above-average givers.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber40" id="SuperscriptNumber40"><sup class="endnote">8</sup></a></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">When hotel maids are told that they have a high-intensity, calorie-burning job, they in turn then burn more calories.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber41" id="SuperscriptNumber41"><sup class="endnote">9</sup></a></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">When a computer gives automated compliments to students, those students perform better on tasks—even when students know those compliments are automated.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber42" id="SuperscriptNumber42"><sup class="endnote">10</sup></a></p>
			<h4 class="x05-Head-B">Positive Labels</h4>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Humans love to be given positive labels. They improve our self-image and gently push us to be better versions of ourselves. So as you use conversation sparkers and see what unexpected directions they lead you in, allow yourself to be impressed by the person across from you. Listen for their eloquent ideas. Find ways to emphasize their strengths. Celebrate their excitement.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Take the rather silly example of the Sorting Hat in the Harry Potter series. At the beginning of each school year, Hogwarts students are sorted into different houses by a magical hat that reads their minds, taking full measure of their hidden skills. Each house is known for different strengths, and as they move to the higher grades, students’ defining characteristics become more and more pronounced. Students in Slytherin tend to be sly, savvy, and interested in the dark arts, whereas those in Hufflepuff often end up in caretaking magical jobs like herbology and care of magical creatures. For better or for worse, the more clear the labels we’re given, the more we embody them.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Here are some examples you could use:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-First">“You know everyone—you must be a great networker!”</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">“I’m amazed by your dedication to this organization—they are lucky to have you.”</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">“You are so knowledgeable in this subject—thank goodness you are here.”</li>
			</ul>
			<h4 class="x05-Head-B">Exponential Excitement</h4>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Another way of highlighting is to celebrate the victories of others as if they were your own. Good feelings multiply around other good <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_80" title="80"/>feelings—and divide when they are not matched. When you see someone who is proud, excited, or passionate—mirror and match it. This associates you with their feelings of pleasure.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">You can say something simple:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-First">“I am so thrilled for you!”</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">“How wonderful that must be!”</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Last">“That is just the best news, congrats!”</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">When I see something—anything, that’s awesome, I always take the opportunity to highlight. I tell my barista his latte art is gorgeous. I gush over my friends’ new haircuts. I send out postcards telling people they’re ballers. Yes, really:</p>
			<div class="w80c">
				<img alt="" class="w100" id="image_pageMap_80" src="../image/48_Youre_a_Baller_rev.jpg"/>
			</div>
			<h3 class="x05-Head-A">SKILL #2: BE A RAVER</h3>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Want to know one of the biggest missed opportunities in social situations? Introductions. I get some version of this e-mail multiple times per week:</p>
			<p class="x06-Extract-1P">Hey Vanessa—I wanted to intro you to Dave. Dave, here is that intro you were asking for. Hope you two connect.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Boring! I have no idea who he is or why I should know him. The same thing happens at networking events, client meetings, and conferences. I <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_81" title="81"/>am almost always introduced to someone in the most boring, generic way possible:</p>
			<p class="x06-Extract-1P">Vanessa, meet John; John, meet Vanessa.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><strong>This is a waste of an opportunity! </strong>Seize introductions as the perfect way to highlight people. Even if you have only known them for a few minutes, you can find something to rave about.</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-First">“Vanessa, meet Dave. He is killing it in the software industry and just had a hugely successful launch.”</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">“Joe, meet Sue. She is an incredible painter and one of the most talented artists I know.”</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Last">“Kirk, let me introduce you to Annie. We just met and she is telling me the most fascinating story of her trip to South Africa.”</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">You can even do this when you’re the one introducing yourself:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-First">“It’s so nice to meet you! I have heard that you have an incredible blog. Please tell me all about how you got all of your success.”</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">“Great to know you, a friend of John is a friend of mine. He always knows the most interesting people.”</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Last">“It’s a pleasure! Your name tag says you work at Ken’s Bakery—they are my favorite pizza in town! Have you always been a pizza aficionado?”</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Why are raving introductions so powerful? First, you give people positive labels right at the start. Second, you tee up a great conversation and possible discussion topics for the people involved. Third, you get people talking about themselves—what they do and who they are, which produces dopamine. Yes, a raving introduction is ALSO a conversational spark. Boom: win-win-win.</p>
			<h3 class="x05-Head-A">SKILL #3: DON’T BE A GOLEM</h3>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Do you know what the opposite of the Pygmalion effect is? The golem effect.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber43" id="SuperscriptNumber43"><sup class="endnote">11</sup></a></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The golem effect is when low expectations lead to poor performance. Major Wilburn Schrank<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber44" id="SuperscriptNumber44"><sup class="endnote">12</sup></a> decided to test the golem effect on incoming <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_82" title="82"/>United States Air Force Academy freshmen. Schrank randomly assigned labels to a group of one hundred enlisted airmen at the United States Air Force Academy Preparatory School. They were given one of five different made-up “ability levels.” The US military is all about labels, rank, and position, so Schrank wanted to know if these labels have any effect on academic performance. Sure enough, for all of the data sets, the airmen who received the worst labels also performed the worst.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The golem effect can have devastating consequences across the board. Dr. Brian McNatt found that the golem effect is especially prevalent in the workplace.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber45" id="SuperscriptNumber45"><sup class="endnote">13</sup></a> Think of bosses who pick favorites. Here’s what happens:</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jeff is the boss. He hires a new sales associate from his alma mater, XYZ University. He takes her under his wing, they grab lunch more often, he gives her the best assignments. After all, Jeff thinks anyone from his alma mater has the best possible education, and he wants his fellow alumni to succeed. She benefits from the Pygmalion effect. Jeff expects the best from her and she performs at her best. Other employees see this favoritism and feel left out. One particular manager, Ken, went to ABC University, XYZ’s rival. Jeff is constantly ribbing Ken—jokingly, of course. Ken doesn’t get invited to watch games at the boss’s house on weekends. Jeff teases Ken for not being able to get into XYZ—Ken knows he’s kidding, but feels the sting anyway.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><strong>Hallway chitchat and watercooler conversations matter.</strong> Expecting the best is not just important for new people, but also to build up the existing people in your life. What are you saying about and to your colleagues?</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Being a highlighter is about constantly searching for the good in people. When you tell people they are good, they become better. When you search for what’s good, you feel great.</p>
			<h3 class="x05-Head-A">BONUS: HELP PEOPLE IMPRESS YOU</h3>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Have you ever wanted to impress people with your knowledge? Your experience? Your success? I think highlighting is actually the key to impressing people.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">My friend Thursday Bram is an amazing highlighter. She runs a club called PyLadies. This is a group of female coders who use the Python programming language. They meet multiple times a week to socialize, brainstorm, and help on coding projects. When Thursday and her fellow <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_83" title="83"/>founders got the idea for the group, it was important for them to create a thriving, supportive group of women.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Thursday got the idea to bring gold star stickers. You know the kind teachers gave us when we were little? Everyone, no matter how old, loves getting a gold star. So at meetings and during events, Thursday passes out gold stars to ladies who contribute an idea, help fix a problem, or are just all-around awesome. Not surprisingly, people love it. And as more and more PyLadies receive gold stars, they act in more and more gold-star-worthy ways. The cycle creates an upward spiral of behavior.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">You don’t actually have to carry around gold star stickers to highlight people—although it would be a fun experiment to try! Instead, highlighting is about giving people emotional gold stars by assigning positive labels, capitalizing on their excitement, and calling out their good deeds.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Being memorable is not about bringing up your high points. It’s about highlighting theirs. <strong>Don’t try to impress people, let them impress you.</strong></p>
			<h3 class="x05-Head-A">HACKING LISTENING</h3>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">I have made my Vow of Silence an annual tradition. It reminds me to pause, stop interrupting, and listen intently. Now, hundreds of my readers join me on these quiet adventures with the hashtag #vowofsilence. We quit social media, turn off e-mail, and just practice listening.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Every time, I am astounded by how many people yell at me during my vow—as if my not speaking somehow also turns off my hearing. Each time, I am shocked when people attempt to use elaborate hand gestures and dramatic dance as they talk to me—quiet is not deaf. Most importantly, after each vow, I am reminded that while listening is an amazing tool to get people to open up, it’s only the first step. Real connection comes from interaction.<span id="footnote-008-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink" href="39_Footnote_9.xhtml">*</a></span></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">I once had dinner with a former fashion model. Genevieve is stunning—shiny auburn hair, milky skin, and superlong legs. During our meal, she was demure, pleasant, and attentive, but barely spoke. When asked a question she would smile, answer quickly, and take a sip of wine. I didn’t think much of the experience and probably wouldn’t have remembered it all until something interesting happened a few weeks later.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_84" title="84"/>I was at a party, talking to a few friends, when Genevieve sauntered up. I turned and introduced her—trying as best as I could to rave. Even though we had spent an evening together, I didn’t have much to go on. So, I kept it simple: “Everyone, meet the lovely Genevieve. We had dinner at that amazing new Italian restaurant on Twenty-third last month.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She shook hands with the group, stayed for a few minutes, and then asked if I wanted to grab another glass of champagne with her. As we walked away, she huffed in exasperation. “Ugh!” she exclaimed. “I have met your friend Chris at least a dozen times. Every time I see him he doesn’t remember me. What’s his problem?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">This didn’t surprise me in the least. Here’s the hard truth: It wasn’t Chris’s fault, it was hers. Genevieve doesn’t give people a reason to remember her. <strong>Being an amazing listener is not just about what you hear, it’s how you respond to what you hear.</strong></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">In every conversation, every interaction, every meeting we have, we want to give people a reason to remember us. Genevieve has supermodel looks and a very pleasant demeanor. But that’s not enough! I can’t help but compare my experience with Genevieve to a daily interaction I have with the parking lot attendant at my gym.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">George directs the traffic in the insanely small parking lot at my local gym. Despite people grumbling at him all day, he always greets everyone happily and asks them the same question: “Want to know the daily fun fact?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The first time he asked me this, I was lost in my own thoughts charging across the lot. It stopped me dead in my tracks. “Daily fun fact?” I was delighted, dopamine pumping in promise of a mental reward. “Of course I want to know the daily fun fact!”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Then he recited his fun fact of the day—which is always something titillating or laugh-worthy like “Did you know Scotland’s national animal is the unicorn?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Or “You can see an owl’s eyeball when you look in its ear.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Or, the one from today, “Russia has a larger surface area than Pluto.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Here’s the best part. Do you know where he gets his fun facts? Us! After he delivers his fact of the day, he asks each person, “Do you have a fun fact for me?” And he waits and listens as people tell him all kinds of obscure tidbits—some real facts and some just fun facts about all aspects of life—talk about using Hack #3: Conversational Sparks.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Inevitably, they end up laughing (and checking Google for verification <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_85" title="85"/>on most). Secretly, I hoard fun facts for him and always hope he will pick mine the next day.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">I used to pull into that lot stressed and miserable trying to squeeze into a parking space. Now, I look for George.</p>

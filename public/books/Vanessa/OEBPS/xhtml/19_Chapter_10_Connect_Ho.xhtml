			<p class="x03-CO-Body-Text"><span class="_idGenDropcap-1">O</span>n May 18, 1926, Aimee Semple McPherson went missing.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The day started off quite normally. McPherson and her secretary went for a swim near Venice Beach. Only a few minutes after diving into the water, McPherson disappeared. Searchers combed the nearby beaches. The city of Los Angeles went on high alert. Nothing.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Then something odd happened. All over the country, people began reporting sightings of McPherson—impossible sightings. Several would come in on the same day, thousands of miles apart. The police received ransom notes from a variety of sources.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">No one could find McPherson, yet everyone could find her. And then, a month after her disappearance, McPherson emerged unharmed from the Mexican desert, claiming she had been kidnapped and held hostage in a shack.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The media was quick to point out that some aspects of McPherson’s story did not add up. (How did she get to Mexico? Why was she unharmed? Who kidnapped her?) The public was enthralled. When she arrived in Los Angeles, over 30,000 people greeted her as a hero at the train station.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">McPherson fanned the flames of fame and funneled her new followers into the Angelus Temple—a church that still runs in Los Angeles today. At one point, 10 percent of Los Angelenos were members at McPherson’s temple.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber91" id="SuperscriptNumber91"><sup class="endnote">1</sup></a></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“And that’s why I want to fake my own kidnapping and start a cult,” said Nicol Paone. The comedian is standing on top of a double-decker bus outside the Angelus Temple, speaking to a rapt group of tourists. The Angelus Temple is only one of many bizarre and hilarious stops on Paone’s alternative comedy show, <em>The Last Show I Do Before I Go on Medication.</em><a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber92" id="SuperscriptNumber92"><sup class="endnote">2</sup></a></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_196" title="196"/>The concept behind the tour is personal, telling of her life in Los Angeles—the breakups, the walks of shame, the drunken stumblings. At one point during the show, Paone pulls the giant bus up in front of her ex-girlfriend’s house and leads the entire bus in singing a rendition of Adele’s song “Hello” as loud as possible. “Occasionally my ex pops her head out of a window and sings with us . . . it depends on what kind of mood she is in,” explained Paone.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">In between stops, Paone ducks tree branches, gives quirky tidbits about Hollywood murders, and points out hidden hangouts. At a particularly long red light, Paone encourages riders to “Get out your phones, post a picture of me on your Instagram, and then hook me up with your most successful friend.” After her fourteenth tour or so, she figured out which blocks to avoid and how to effectively catcall pedestrians.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Paone never imagined her tour would become a local Hollywood highlight, that she would have a waitlist for shows, or that she’d be approached by TV executives about turning her bus tour into a series. She’d originally assumed the show would be a onetime thing. “My life was failing. I had no money, no job, and my girlfriend and I had just broken up,” she explained. So she turned comedy into her therapist, and used the bus as her exposure therapy.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Her very first show was a terrifying experience. “I basically screamed at everyone for an hour and a half and felt like throwing up every time we got to a new location.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">But she forced herself to be honest. Stories of botched dates, relationship shenanigans, and ridiculous encounters poured out. “I was sharing my deepest secrets and shameful moments. It was both frightening and freeing,” said Paone.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber93" id="SuperscriptNumber93"><sup class="endnote">3</sup></a></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The next day, while Paone was dealing with what she calls her “vulnerability hangover,” people began to talk about the show, and especially about Paone’s raw humor and openness. Since then, Paone has done over twenty live bus shows. Every single one sells out.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">When Paone speaks, people not only listen—they beg to hear more. Paone accidentally stumbled upon the ultimate shortcut to connection. <strong>She is a storyteller.</strong></p>

			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">After a lifetime of failed business ideas, toymaker Ty Warner emptied his savings and mortgaged his home, convinced he had an idea worth betting it all on.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">It was a radical twist on the sweet, fluffy stuffed animal he’d seen a million times.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He decided that his stuffed animals would come with a name, a birthday, and a story. There was Pinchers the Lobster, born June 19, 1993. He came with a story, too, and it went like this:</p>
			<p class="x06-Verse-First">This lobster loves to pinch</p>
			<p class="x06-Verse">Eating his food inch by inch</p>
			<p class="x06-Verse">Balancing carefully with his tail</p>
			<p class="x06-Verse-Last">Moving forward slow as a snail!</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">And there was Chocolate the Moose and Squealer the Pig and Splash the Whale. Finally Ty Warner created something that flew off the shelves. Kids didn’t want just one Beanie Baby—they wanted every single one. At its peak, Beanie Babies pulled in over $700 million in one year.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber94" id="SuperscriptNumber94"><sup class="endnote">4</sup></a></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Warner understood that we feel connected to someone (or something) when we hear their story.</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-First">Stories give us a chance to say “me too,” activating the similarity attraction effect.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Stories create conversation sparks—they give us pleasure when we listen.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Last">Stories help bond storytellers to story listeners.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Researchers Greg Stephens, Lauren Silbert, and Uri Hasson wanted to know what happens in our brains as we listen to stories. They put participants in fMRI machines and recorded the brain activity of two people—one person sharing a story and one person listening to the story. What they saw was striking—the two brains began to “sync” up. As the speaker told a story, the listener’s brain patterns began to match.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber95" id="SuperscriptNumber95"><sup class="endnote">5</sup></a></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_198" title="198"/>Spanish researchers even found that reading words like “perfume” or “coffee” lights up our primary olfactory cortex, where we process smell. If you hear a story about a creamy crème brûlée, your brain pictures the crème brûlée, imagines the taste, and conjures up the sweet smell and smooth feeling on your tongue. Even though you do not have the crème brûlée in front of you, your brain responds as if you do. Imagining a sensory experience activates the same part of your brain as the real experience would. And when someone tells you a story, your brain acts as if you were present in the story. Researchers call this neural coupling. I call it connection hacking.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">This cognitive mechanism makes stories the perfect shortcut to connection. Stories help us literally get on the same wavelength as the people we are with. They not only listen to what we are saying but also <em>experience</em> what we are saying.<strong> Even simple stories rev up brain activity and sync us up with the people around us.</strong></p>

			<h3 class="x05-Head-A">STORY HACKER</h3>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Confession: You know those people who call you during dinner and ask for money? I used to be one. I was that person you hung up on. Yes, I used to be a telemarketer. Well, not quite a telemarketer, but close. To make extra money in college, I worked at the Emory Telefund. Every night for three years, I called Emory alumni and asked them to donate to their alma mater.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">This was the worst and best job I ever had. It forced me to get out of my comfort zone, bond with people quickly, and become numb to the word “no.” Most importantly, it taught me the ultimate connection hack: telling stories.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The first few weeks on the job were the hardest. On the first night, you sit down at a large bank of computers and plug your headset into an autodial system. As the call connects, you have five to seven seconds to speed-read the contact card that pops up on your screen and quickly memorize any relevant details about the caller. I typically aimed to recall <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_199" title="199"/>their name, graduation year, and major. If you were lucky, you got four to five rings to memorize the data. And then:</p>
			<p class="x06-Dialogue-First">“Hello?”</p>
			<p class="x06-Dialogue-Last">“Hi, Mr. Smith. I’m calling from the Emory University Telefund. I would like to ask you about making a donation—” <em>Click.</em></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">A click wasn’t as bad as some of the more expletive-filled alternatives. If you managed to keep someone on the line, you had to quickly, and in my case, awkwardly, ask for a small donation to the school. In my first two hundred calls, I was lucky to keep one, maybe two people on the line. Getting donations from those two people, well, let’s just say, I wasn’t earning my keep.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Finally, one night a manager took pity on my abysmal numbers and constant hang-ups. He came over, unplugged my headset, and said simply, “Do you love Emory?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yes, of course! That’s why I’m here trying to raise money for us.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Okay, great,” he said. “Why do you love Emory?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">This was easy: “Well, I love Emory because I think it has some of the best teachers in the country, it has an amazing community, and the campus is beautiful . . .”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Stop,” he interrupted me. “That’s how I want you to approach these calls. You love Emory, these alumni love Emory. Just tell them stories about that.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">My manager was right. It didn’t matter that these alumni had graduated fifty years ago, or that we had different majors, or that we lived in different areas of the country. We had stories to share.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">From that point on, I approached my calls with two goals. In the first part of the call, all I wanted to do was share a story about Emory—maybe about homecoming weekend, the new gym, or a fun professor prank on campus. I didn’t realize it then, but this first story was <strong>aligning</strong> the alumni and me.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">In the second part of the call, my goal was to get them to tell me a story. I wanted to hear about their time at Emory—what had changed, whether they had been back for a visit, or what their favorite moment at the school was. In the end, if they donated, great. If not, that was okay, too. My single goal was to hunt for stories.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_200" title="200"/>Slowly, as my stories got better, my calls got better, too.</p>
			<p class="x06-Dialogue-First">“Hello?”</p>
			<p class="x06-Dialogue">“Hi, Mr. Smith, my name is Vanessa and I am a sophomore at Emory University. I was wondering if you had a few minutes to reminisce about Emory?”</p>
			<p class="x06-Dialogue">“A sophomore, huh? How is our football team doing these days?”</p>
			<p class="x06-Dialogue">“Great, sir, still undefeated.” (Emory doesn’t have a football team, so this is a campus-wide inside joke.) “Actually, this past weekend was homecoming, and we had a giant float made of Georgia peaches. Did you do that for homecoming back in 1978?”</p>
			<p class="x06-Dialogue">“Oh goodness, let’s see. I think we had a parade, but we had water balloons back in those days.”</p>
			<p class="x06-Dialogue">“No way! We would get in huge trouble if we had water balloons on campus today. You know how they are about the flower beds.”</p>
			<p class="x06-Dialogue">“Ha, yes, I remember how angry the gardeners got when we played soccer on the lawn! Well, what can I help you with, young lady?”</p>
			<p class="x06-Dialogue">“Yes sir, I am calling from Emory Telefund. Last year you gave a very generous donation of one hundred dollars, and I was wondering if you would be willing to make a donation of $150. I can also mark it especially for the history department, since that was your major.”</p>
			<p class="x06-Dialogue-Last">“You can do that? Well, that would be great. And please say hi to Mr. Talbott if he is still there.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Not only did the donations start rolling in, but I began to <em>love</em> my job. I learned about hidden nooks in the library, I got tips on how to game the housing lottery system, and I learned so much about my fellow alumni. Every week, I would save stories to tell on my calls and think of new ways to ask for stories. I became a story hunter and a story hacker. And now you can, too.</p>
			<p class="x06-Extract-A-First">HACK #10: The Story Stack</p>
			<p class="x06-Extract-A-Last">Share, tell, and hunt for captivating stories to capture imagination and attention.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_201" title="201"/>Many of us instinctively understand the power of stories, but have trouble knowing how to use them in everyday life. I want to give you an easy way to swap, share, and hunt for stories. I call this your Story Stack.</p>
			<h3 class="x05-Head-A">STORY STACK</h3>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Computer programmers use “stacks” to organize the various components of a software system. For example, my website ScienceofPeople.com is hosted on WP Engine, runs on WordPress software, and uses Cloudflare as a content delivery network. This is the stack of tools that works together to create my website.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The easiest way to harness the power of stories is to have a Story Stack with your favorite anecdotes, narratives, and follow-up questions all in one place, ready to use. Here’s how it works:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-First"><strong>Trigger Topic: </strong>You know how the same subjects tend to come up over and over again in conversations? I call these trigger topics. When chatting over drinks or meeting new people, we constantly hear about the weather, traffic, weekend plans, and latest TV shows. These are commonly talked about, safe, generic areas. These are the first level in your Story Stack. When you hear a trigger topic, you can use it as a launching pad to tell your stories. Take a look at the list below and add any topics that frequently come up in your conversations.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted"><strong>Sparking Stories: </strong>We have stories about everything, but we very rarely stop to take stock of them. Sparking stories are those anecdotes that produce laughter, ahas, groans, and great follow-up conversation. Use the prompts below to hunt for at least one story for each trigger topic.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Last"><strong>Boomerang: </strong>After you are done telling a story, you always want to bring the conversation back around to the other person you are speaking with. They can then answer and send it back to you. I call this throwing a boomerang—at the end of your story, how can you tie the idea back to them? What question can you ask to hunt for their stories? How can you get them talking? Or how can you make them laugh?</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_202" title="202"/>Let me give you an example of how this works before you begin on your own Story Stack. Let’s say I am at a business lunch and someone brings up the latest comedy special on HBO. Comedy is one of my trigger topics. I wait to see if there will be a lull in the conversation and then bring out a story from my stack. It goes something like this:</p>
			<p class="x06-Dialogue-First"><span class="_6-Dialogue-Speaker">COLLEAGUE:</span> I just finished the Aziz Ansari HBO special. So good.</p>
			<p class="x06-Dialogue"><span class="_6-Dialogue-Speaker">ME:</span> Yeah, I could spend a whole weekend watching comedy specials on Netflix. I used to watch Bill Maher all the time, but after I humiliated myself in front of him, I could never watch him the same way again.</p>
			<p class="x06-Dialogue"><span class="_6-Dialogue-Speaker">COLLEAGUE:</span> What?! What do you mean?</p>
			<p class="x06-Dialogue"><span class="_6-Dialogue-Speaker">ME:</span> One time, my husband and I were waiting in a crowded parking lot in West Hollywood after a movie. It was freezing and the attendant was taking forever to bring us our car. All of a sudden, I see this giant black SUV roll up into the lot, and the attendants wave it right to the front. My husband and I immediately start wondering out loud whose car it might be. We joked that the rims weren’t cool enough to be a rapper and the license wasn’t short enough to be a politician. Right as we began to riff on the leather seats, I turn to see Bill Maher standing there giving us death stares. Yes, it was his car and yes, he heard the whole exchange. It was so awkward!</p>
			<p class="x06-Dialogue"><span class="_6-Dialogue-Speaker">COLLEAGUE:</span> Oh no! That’s so embarrassing! Did he laugh or was he serious?</p>
			<p class="x06-Dialogue"><span class="_6-Dialogue-Speaker">ME:</span> He didn’t even crack a smile, so I felt really bad. Anyway, have you ever seen a celebrity in real life?</p>
			<p class="x06-Dialogue-Last"><span class="_6-Dialogue-Speaker">COLLEAGUE:</span> Oh yeah! This one time . . .</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">I used a story to bond with my colleague and hack what could have been a predictably boring conversation. Then I threw a boomerang to get him telling me a story.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Now, it’s your turn. Fill out the Story Stack below with as many trigger topics, sparking stories, and boomerangs as you can think of.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><strong>Remember:</strong> Your stories don’t have to be originals. Heard a funny story at work? Add it to your stack. Read a funny anecdote in this book? Add it to your stack.</p>

			<h3 class="x05-Head-A">THE ART OF STORYTELLING</h3>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Having a great Story Stack isn’t much good if you’re not a great storyteller. Three simple elements differentiate an okay story from an awesome one:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-First"><strong>Start with a Hook: </strong>You have to grab attention from the start. A hook is a provocative question, stimulating statement, or open-ended idea to pique interest. I started my Bill Maher story with the hook, “I used to watch Bill Maher all the time, but after I humiliated myself in front of him, I could never watch him the same way again.” Invariably, this hook gets people curious.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted"><strong><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_205" title="205"/>Champion a Struggle: </strong>The best stories have at their center some kind of a struggle. A question, a problem to be solved, or a challenge to be overcome. In the Bill Maher story, the struggle was “Who’s in the car?” Or think of it as creating suspense. Can you hint at something? Are you facing off against someone else? Is there a punch line on the way?</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Last"><strong>Utilize Provocative Words:</strong> Remember how the brain’s olfactory system lights up when it hears the words “perfume” and “coffee”? The more descriptive your story, the more your listeners’ brains will light up. Spice up your story by adding expressive, interesting words.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">You can use all three of these elements in under two minutes—and you <em>should</em> keep your story short. After three minutes you become a conversation hog.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Once you start using this model, it becomes easy to turn a boring anecdote into a laugh-worthy story. The author Susan Cain used this structure to get over 14 million views on her TED Talk on introversion.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber96" id="SuperscriptNumber96"><sup class="endnote">6</sup></a> She used the hook, struggle, and boomerang format to captivate her audience.</p>
			<p class="x07-List-Unnumbered-First"><strong>Hook</strong>: When I was nine years old, I went off to summer camp for the first time. And my mother packed me a suitcase full of books, which to me seemed like a perfectly natural thing to do. Because in my family, reading was the primary group activity.</p>
			<p class="x07-List-Unnumbered"><strong>Struggle:</strong> And this might sound antisocial to you, but for us it was really just a different way of being social. You have the animal warmth of your family sitting right next to you, but you are also free to go roaming around the adventureland inside your own mind. And I had this idea that camp was going to be just like this, but better.</p>
			<p class="x07-List-Unnumbered"><strong>Unique Words:</strong> I had a vision of ten girls sitting in a cabin cozily reading books in their matching nightgowns. But camp was more like a keg party without any alcohol. And on the very first day, our counselor gathered us all together and taught us a cheer that she said we’d be doing every day for the rest of the summer to instill camp spirit. And it went like this: “R-O-W-D-I-E, that’s the way we spell rowdie. Rowdie, rowdie, let’s get rowdie.”</p>
			<p class="x07-List-Unnumbered-Last"><strong><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_206" title="206"/>Boomerang:</strong> Yeah. So I couldn’t figure out for the life of me why we were supposed to be so rowdy, or why we had to spell this word incorrectly.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Cain could have told this same story in a boring way by simply saying:</p>
			<p class="x06-Extract-1P">Even though many people see reading as antisocial, for me, it was a family activity. When I went to camp, it was incredibly hard to find my place.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Instead, she added elements to get people hooked to her struggle. And her boomerang was getting the audience to laugh—which is the best kind of boomerang in front of a large group.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Having trouble thinking about how to fit your own stories into this structure? No worries! I’ve got you covered. I created a fill-in-the-blank game for you to practice. The trigger topic here is “Commuting.” Sound boring? No way, we are going to turn it into a mini-story using the formula above. Just fill in the blanks:</p>
			<ol>
				<li class="x07-List-Numbered-1-First" value="1">Hook: You want to know the most ______ I ever saw while driving?</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Numbered-1">Struggle: I was driving down the road and all of a sudden, I look over and see ____.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Numbered-1">Unique Words: And it was so ____!</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Numbered-1-Last">Boomerang: Have you ever seen someone do something ____ in their car?</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Let’s try this again with the trigger topic “Fascinating People.” This one can be a bit longer. Think of a person you were very excited to meet—this can be anyone you were excited to meet at any time in your life.</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-First">Hook: One time, ____ years ago, I encountered one of the coolest people I have ever met.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Struggle: It might sound ____, but I had always wanted to meet _____ because _____. Beforehand, I was so ____. Finally, the moment came.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_207" title="207"/>Unique Words: And it was _____! What surprised me most about meeting them was _____________. I’ll never forget ________.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Last">Boomerang: Who is the coolest person you have ever met?</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Practice this formula with the middle column “Sparking Story” in your Story Stack above. Go through your Story Stack and see if you can think of hooks and struggles for each anecdote.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Another fun way to hear casual stories in action is by watching sitcoms—this is how I learned to tell short, witty stories. Sitcom writers have to condense character-building stories into funny anecdotes. The TV sitcom <em>How I Met Your Mother</em> has dozens of examples of this. In the pilot, Ted asks Robin, “What do you do?” (Trigger Topic) and she says:</p>
			<p class="x07-List-Unnumbered-First">I’m a reporter for Metro News One . . . well kinda a reporter” (Hook)</p>
			<p class="x07-List-Unnumbered-Last">I do those dumb little fluff pieces at the end of the news you know like “monkey who can play the ukulele.” I am hoping to get some bigger stories soon.” (Struggle)</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">A few minutes later he asks her about her future plans (Trigger Topic).</p>
			<p class="x07-List-Unnumbered-First">Ted: “Hey, you want to have dinner with me on Saturday night?”</p>
			<p class="x07-List-Unnumbered">Robin: “Oh, I can’t, I’m going to Orlando for a week on Friday. (Hook)</p>
			<p class="x07-List-Unnumbered">Some guy is attempting to make the world’s biggest pancake. (Struggle)</p>
			<p class="x07-List-Unnumbered-Last">Guess who’s covering it. (Boomerang)</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Notice these mini-stories all have a bit of humor in them. Humor often comes from something unexpected or surprising. Don’t be shy about testing your jokes on different audiences. Just practice telling your story and see when and where you get laughs and smiles.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Use audience feedback to make adjustments to the stories in your stack. Don’t be afraid to play around with nonverbal emphases, pauses, and embellishments as you practice telling your stories.<span id="footnote-016-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink" href="47_Footnote_17.xhtml">*</a></span></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">One of my favorite classrooms for learning the art of storytelling? The <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_208" title="208"/><em>New York Times</em>. Award-winning journalists, editors, and writers help make the <em>New York Times</em> a world-renowned news agency. And we can learn from them.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">One of my researchers, Robby Smith, and I designed a small experiment to analyze the types of <em>New York Times</em> articles that go viral. Over the course of four months from October 2015 to January 2016, Robby logged and coded all of their most-read pieces. He analyzed the topics of each article, the format of the titles, headlines, and the promise of each article.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">We were particularly interested in the promise of an article. What does the title suggest the article will offer? In other words, if the reader clicks on it, what will it give them? A new outcome? A lesson? A surprise? An update? Here are the categories we used:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-First"><strong>Question:</strong> For instance, the article titled “Can You Get Smarter?” from October 2015.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted"><strong>How to:</strong> Many headlines suggested tips, self-help, or a way of doing something new. “What You Can Do about Climate Change” was the title of an article from December 2015.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted"><strong>History:</strong> Other titles referenced a time, period, or moment in history, such as “The Hard-Working Italian Origins of the Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree” from December 2015.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted"><strong>Snark:</strong> This category included any headline that had a clever, funny, or punny title. We all laughed when we came across “This Column Is Gluten-Free.”</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted"><strong>New:</strong> For example, “Everything You Need to Know about the New SAT” came out in October 2015.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Last"><strong>Story:</strong> Well-crafted headlines can imply you’re on the brink of reading a great story about a person or place. “My Dark California Dream” or “Lady Gaga and the Life of Passion” are two examples.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Thirty-five percent of the articles on the viral list promised a story—195 out of 559 total articles—making it by far the most effective category.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber97" id="SuperscriptNumber97"><sup class="endnote">7</sup></a></p>
			<div class="w100">
				<img alt="" class="w100" id="image_pageMap_209" src="../image/87_NYT_Promise_Graph.jpg"/>
			</div>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_209" title="209"/>Take a look at the most e-mailed article list on the <em>New York Times</em> website for yourself. You’ll see how the same storytelling formula comes up over and over again. First, the writers hook you with the slightest hint of a story in their title. Then, they quickly introduce a struggle or challenge that needs to be solved, and finally, they paint a picture with attention-grabbing words.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Whether you want your pitch to go viral, your e-mail to be read, or people to like your status updates, hook people with the power of stories.</p>
			<h3 class="x05-Head-A">REALITY BITES</h3>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">You can use your Story Stack and the three-step storytelling technique in person, in e-mails, and even in your profiles.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Every week, we send out a free Science of People insights e-mail to over 100,000 subscribers. It’s filled with cool people science, human behavior hacks, and communication tips. I once sent out a link to one of our articles called, “Why Couples Fight.” Instead of just plopping the link in the e-mail, I decided to include a short story about my husband and me. It went like this:</p>
			<p class="x06-Extract-First"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_210" title="210"/>Subject: The Top 5 Issues Couples Fight About</p>
			<p class="x06-Extract">Darling, will you please pick up your sock?</p>
			<p class="x06-Extract">Babe, please pick up your dirty socks!</p>
			<p class="x06-Extract">PLEASE pick up your smelly, germy, practically decayed socks!!</p>
			<p class="x06-Extract">If you were a fly on the wall of my house, you might hear this sequence occasionally. Do you have the same argument with your partner over and over again? You’re not alone!</p>
			<p class="x06-Extract">Get this crazy fact: <strong>According to Dr. John Gottman, 69 percent of relationship conflicts are never solved!</strong></p>
			<p class="x06-Extract">Whoa, whoa, whoa, it’ll all be okeydokey, let Mama Vanessa fix it! Sixty-nine percent of us fight about the same things over and over again—that’s the bad news. But here’s the good news:</p>
			<p class="x06-Extract"><strong>If we know what we fight about and how it happens, we can turn down the heat on our arguments.</strong></p>
			<p class="x06-Extract-Last">Find out what your top issues are and how to solve them. [Link]</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">This e-mail had a far higher open rate and click-through rate than average. Why? Yes, I told a story, but I was also being real. I told an honest story about my real husband and something we really fight about. In fact, my husband even texted me that he thought he really did forget to pick up his socks that morning.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Comedian Nicol Paone is popular for her bitingly real stories. They’re funny, they’re heart-wrenching, and most importantly, they connect us to her.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I think in some ways people relate to my stories. Sure, they laugh, but they also can imagine being in that same spot themselves. Maybe they made a similar mistake,” says Paone. “There is connection through failure. When you hear someone else’s failure you are less judgmental of your own,” she added.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The best stories are the ones that share both failures and successes. Don’t be afraid to share something a little embarrassing, a little vulnerable, a little scary. These are the stories that build the best connection.</p>
			<h3 class="x05-Head-A">CHALLENGES</h3>
			<ol>
				<li class="x07-List-Numbered-1-First-No-Space" value="1">Think of three stories that you enjoy telling.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Numbered-1">Find the hook, struggle, and expressive words to best share them, and then practice them on a friend.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Numbered-1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_211" title="211"/>Create a note in your phone or on your computer to remember great stories when you hear them.</li>
			</ol>
			<h3 class="x05-Head-A">CHAPTER REVIEW</h3>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Stories are your shortcut to connection. Stories spark our attention and align the listener’s brain patterns with those of the storyteller. Using your Story Stack is the best way to get someone in line with your way of thinking.</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-First">Stories light up and sync up our brains.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Find stories for common trigger topics that come up in conversation, then use boomerangs to ask people to share their own stories.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Last">Not all stories are created equal. Every story should have a hook, a struggle, and vivid words.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="x07-List-Unnumbered"><strong>My biggest takeaway in this chapter is: </strong>_______________</p>

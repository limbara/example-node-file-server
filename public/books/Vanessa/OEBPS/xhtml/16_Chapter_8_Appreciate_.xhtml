			<h2 class="x03-Chapter-Title">APPRECIATE</h2>
			<h2 class="x03-Chapter-Subtitle">How to get the best from people</h2>
			<p class="x03-CO-Body-Text"><span class="_idGenDropcap-1">E</span>very time I see Paige Hendrix Buckner, she pulls a present for me out of her pocket or purse. Sometimes it’s herbs from her garden that she’s wrapped lovingly in a damp paper towel. Sometimes it’s my favorite kind of candy. Basically, she’s a younger, spunkier version of my grandma. She has a special talent for finding the perfect gift for each person she meets.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">A few years ago, she started capitalizing on her talent for gift giving. Local businesspeople told her they wanted to one-up the generic fruit basket when they sent presents to clients, employees, and business partners. Luckily, there is no better place than Paige’s home state of Oregon to find talented local artisans. This became her unique angle—working solely with the best Oregon products she could find and packaging them in distinctive handmade boxes with catchy themes. She named her company ClientJoy.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">In her Night on the Town box, she has Masala Spiced Popcorn, The Bitter Housewife’s cardamom bitters, Raft Lemon Ginger Syrup, flake salt by Jacobsen Salt Co., and hazelnuts by Albina City Nuts.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">In her Sweet and Spicy box, she has local honey from Bee Local, Tracy’s Small-Batch Granola, Marshall’s Gin Roasted Pepper Haute Sauce, and Olympia Provisions Pepperettes jerky.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Following her passion had its challenges, but she has kept it alive by modeling on the side to pay for groceries and rent. (Paige is the stunning raven-haired model in many of the microexpression photos in this book!) Luckily, in the spring of 2014 Paige got her big break. ClientJoy boxes found their way into the hands of some serious influencers at TEDxPortland. “Speakers were blown away with authentically custom <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_157" title="157"/>gift boxes filled with love and creativity,” said the executive producer of the event, David Rae.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The word got out. Now ClientJoy boxes are being sent to companies around the country, from the Dallas Cowboys to Twitter to <em>Time </em>magazine—everyone is getting a taste of Oregon.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">What has driven Paige’s success? ClientJoy makes curated gifts that don’t feel obligatory. “For me, gifting is about showing gratitude. It’s about making an easier way to give appreciation to someone. I think appreciation is one of the most powerful tools we have,” said Paige.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">ClientJoy taps into a deep human need—the desire to be genuinely appreciated.</p>
			<p class="x06-Epigraph">According to the U.S. Department of Labor, the number-one reason people leave their jobs is because they “do not feel appreciated.”</p>

			<h3 class="x05-Head-A">THE PSYCHOLOGY OF APPRECIATION</h3>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">My dad’s birthday is November 4. This means that every August while growing up, I began the painstaking process of coming up with a spectacular gift idea.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">One year, I hand knit him a tie from yarn that I spun myself. Another year, I made an exact replica of his office in miniature using matchsticks, jewelry boxes, and buttons. Another year, I gave him a painting of a watermelon (his favorite food) covered in over 2,000 sequins (placed by hand one at a time). One year, I gave him a book of over thirty personalized coupons for things I knew he enjoyed, like hugs, Coffee Bean lattes, and Lakers games.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">At his birthday dinner, I would place my latest contraption in front of my dad and wait expectantly. Every year, he had about the same reaction: “Oh,” he would say cautiously. He would poke it, lift it up, and turn it around a few times. “I love it.” But he said this with the kind of voice tone reserved for telling a small child her imaginary friend had died or that the Christmas tree was infested with aphids. And then, a few weeks later, my loving creation would be moved to the attic. And eventually, I suspect, it was secretly placed in the alley garbage cans.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Year after year, no matter how hard I tried, I missed the mark on my <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_158" title="158"/>dad’s gifts. Then one fall, I got mono (don’t ask). That year on November 4, I dragged my sick, lymph-swollen, pale body to the couch and told my dad, “This year for your birthday I only have the energy to watch Sunday football with you. I hope that’s okay.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">For the next four hours, we ate cheesy pretzels and chatted about team mascots. I finally learned how the whole yardage thing works. Sitting down to his birthday dinner, my dad clapped me on the back and said it was the best present I had ever given him.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">What the what? I watched a few football games and ate junk food—how could that have possibly been better than his own personalized scented candle collection? What I learned that day is that everyone has different ways of showing and feeling love.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Dr. Gary Chapman has been helping couples as a marriage and family therapist for over fifty years. During the scope of his career, he began to notice patterns in the way couples showed (or didn’t show) affection toward each other. He found that there were five different ways people tended to express love—what he calls the 5 Love Languages. If you haven’t heard of these before, here’s the quick and dirty summary:<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber73" id="SuperscriptNumber73"><sup class="endnote">1</sup></a></p>
			<ol>
				<li class="x07-List-Numbered-First" value="1"><strong>Words of Affirmation:</strong> People with this love language express their care through spoken or written word—love letters, texts, and verbal expressions of love.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Numbered"><strong>Gifts: </strong>People with this love language express their care through small gifts or tokens of appreciation—jewelry, candy, or flowers.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Numbered"><strong>Physical Touch: </strong>People with this love language express their care through touch—hugs, cuddles, pats on the back, loving embraces.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Numbered"><strong>Acts of Service: </strong>People with this love language express their care by doing things for others—cooking their spouse dinner, running errands, or crafting something for them. (If you couldn’t tell from the story about my dad, this is mine.)</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Numbered-Last"><strong>Quality Time: </strong>People with this love language express their care with their time. They want to simply be in the presence of the people they care about.</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Dr. Chapman argues that most relationship difficulties arise when we’re speaking different languages. For example, if a wife’s love language is Words of Affirmation, she lights up when her husband tells her he misses her. However, her husband’s love language is Physical Touch, so when he <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_159" title="159"/>gets home from work, he doesn’t want to talk, he just wants to snuggle with her on the couch. When she pulls away, he feels hurt, and when he doesn’t ask about her day, she feels stung. Over time, this eats away at the couple.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Dr. Chapman worked with fellow psychologist Dr. Paul White to adapt the love languages for the professional environment. Their collaboration produced the five “appreciation languages.” Behavior hackers, take note.</p>
			<h3 class="x05-Head-A">JUST SAYING THANKS ISN’T ENOUGH</h3>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Feeling underappreciated eats away at employees who shoulder hard projects on their own, moms who aren’t thanked for cleaning up after kids, and friends who feel like they always end up hosting.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Lack of appreciation is an especially pernicious problem in the workplace—and it’s often overlooked. In fact, 65 percent of Americans say they received no recognition in the workplace in the last year.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber74" id="SuperscriptNumber74"><sup class="endnote">2</sup></a></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">When you ask managers why most employees leave their jobs, 88 percent of them believe <strong>money</strong> is at the root of most job turnover.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber75" id="SuperscriptNumber75"><sup class="endnote">3</sup></a> In fact, only 12 percent of employees leave for financial reasons. The other 88 percent boils down to job satisfaction.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">What makes someone love their job? That question is not so simple, but the Society for Human Resource Management feels that job satisfaction boils down to <strong>employee recognition and engagement</strong>.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber76" id="SuperscriptNumber76"><sup class="endnote">4</sup></a> However, one recent Gallup study found that almost <strong>70 percent of US employees say they receive no praise or recognition in the workplace</strong>.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber77" id="SuperscriptNumber77"><sup class="endnote">5</sup></a></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">When we feel underappreciated we:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-First">Are less productive</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Have a harder time working on teams</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Are less motivated</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Feel more discouraged</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Complain more</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Have lower life satisfaction</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Last">Have lower job satisfaction</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Appreciation is essential for a happy life, happy relationships, and a happy workplace. But it’s not that simple. As Dr. Chapman discovered, we each express and feel appreciation in different ways.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_160" title="160"/>While filming my Master Your People Skills course, I had our studio audience members write love letters to someone important to them. As always with most of my activities, there was a catch. I told the students they had to write the letter with their nondominant hand. In a matter of minutes, all of the students were moaning of hand cramps and their letters were barely legible. <strong>Asking someone to use their nonnatural appreciation language is like asking someone to write with their nondominant hand—it’s difficult, sloppy, and frequently causes misunderstandings.</strong></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Until you learn how to hack the appreciation languages.</p>
			<p class="x06-Epigraph">Next to physical survival, the greatest need of a human being is psychological survival—to be understood, to be affirmed, to be validated, to be appreciated.</p>
			<p class="x06-Epigraph-Source">—Stephen Covey</p>
			<h3 class="x05-Head-A">HACK #8: THE APPRECIATION MATRIX</h3>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">After a few years of using the matrix for personality traits, I found there was something missing. Solving someone’s five personality traits could only get me so far. I definitely could better understand and predict behavior, and casual conversations were easier, but it didn’t help with some of the deeper parts of connection.</p>
			<div class="w30c">
				<img alt="" class="w100" id="image_pageMap_160" src="../image/81_Appreciation_Matrix.jpg"/>
			</div>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">When I found Dr. Chapman and Dr. White’s five appreciation languages, it clicked. The matrix isn’t a key to accessing a single piece of information; it is more like an onion. Each layer you uncover about someone reveals something new about how they operate.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The first layer, as we already learned, is how someone falls on each of the five personality traits. The second layer is how someone expresses appreciation, and how they feel it.</p>
			<h4 class="x05-Head-B">#1: You</h4>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Dr. Chapman found that most people have a primary and a secondary appreciation language. Before I give you the official quiz, think about your answers to these questions:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-First"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_161" title="161"/>Let’s pretend your best friend just got a big promotion at work. How would you celebrate them?</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">When did someone last surprise you with how much they care? What did they do for you?</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">What was the best birthday celebration, gift, or experience you have ever had?</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">What’s one thing you wish your partner did more of? Less of?</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Last">If you had $1,000 to spend on a treat for yourself, what would you do with it?</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Do you notice any patterns? Since our appreciation language stays with us, it often plays out in all of our relationships throughout our life—with parents, colleagues, friends, and partners.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Now let’s take the quiz based on Dr. Chapman’s research.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber78" id="SuperscriptNumber78"><sup class="endnote">6</sup></a> Use the following statements to decipher your appreciation language:</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">For each pair of statements, check the <strong>ONE</strong> answer that fits best with your relationships (partner, family, friends, colleagues).</p>
			<ol>
				<li class="x07-List-Numbered-1-First" value="1">I like to receive encouraging notes. ____</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Numbered-1">I like to be hugged. ____</li>
			</ol>
			<ol>
				<li class="x07-List-Numbered-1-Start-3" value="3">I like to spend one-on-one time with close friends. ____</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Numbered-1-Last">I feel cared for when a friend helps me out. ____</li>
			</ol>
			<ol>
				<li class="x07-List-Numbered-1-Start-5" value="5">I like it when people give me gifts. ____</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Numbered-1-Last">Compliments are important to me. ____</li>
			</ol>
			<ol>
				<li class="x07-List-Numbered-1-Start-7" value="7">I feel appreciated when someone I care for puts his or her arm around me. ____</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Numbered-1-Last">I feel close to someone when we are doing an activity together. __</li>
			</ol>
			<ol>
				<li class="x07-List-Numbered-1-Start-9" value="9">I feel appreciated when a colleague offers to help me with a job or project. ____</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Numbered-1">I appreciate it when someone remembers special days with a gift. ____</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="x07-List-Head"><strong><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_162" title="162"/>Answer Key:</strong></p><p class="x07-List-Unnumbered">Words of Affirmation: 1 and 6</p><p class="x07-List-Unnumbered">Physical Touch: 2 and 7</p><p class="x07-List-Unnumbered">Quality Time: 3 and 8</p><p class="x07-List-Unnumbered">Acts of Service: 4 and 9</p><p class="x07-List-Unnumbered">Gifts: 5 and 10</p><p class="x07-List-Unnumbered">Your primary appreciation is: _______________________</p>
			<p class="x07-List-Unnumbered-Last">Your secondary appreciation is: _____________________</p>

			<p class="x04-Body-Text">You can write these into your matrix along with your personality rankings. I like to put the primary language on the top part of the circle and the secondary language on the bottom half.</p>
			<div class="w80c">
				<img alt="" class="w100" id="image_pageMap_162" src="../image/82_Primary_Secondary_graphic_dual.jpg"/>
			</div>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">This information is not to be taken lightly. It has a huge impact on your overall happiness. When you know your appreciation language, you are able to:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-First"><strong>Know What to Ask For:</strong> Your partner cannot read your mind. Neither can your boss, your friends, or your colleagues. Understanding your love language can help you know what to ask for when you need support. If your language is Words of Affirmation, you can ask your boss for more verbal feedback and plan catch-up meetings at the end of long weeks. If your language is Quality Time, you know that long-distance relationships or working virtually might not be a good choice for you. Set the people in your life up for success by telling them how you best feel appreciated by them.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Last"><strong><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_163" title="163"/>Understand What’s Missing: </strong>Whenever I teach the appreciation languages, the majority of my students have some kind of relationship aha moment. They realize that a fight they have been having with someone in their life has been caused by a difference in appreciation languages. For example, one of my students, Leila, whose primary appreciation language is Acts of Service, is constantly hosting her girlfriend for martini nights, cooking clubs, and brunches. Leila feels like she is the only one who ever does anything and has been feeling bad about the friendship. However, after this lesson, Leila realized her friend’s language is Words of Affirmation and always writes her long thank-you text messages and gushes about how much she loves these get-togethers. While this expression of appreciation doesn’t mean as much to Leila, she now knows what to ask for and where her friend is coming from.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">When you pair your appreciation language with your personality rankings, you’ll have doubly powerful insights. For example, if you are low open and your primary appreciation language is Quality Time, you would be better off asking a colleague to a monthly coffee date at your favorite place. If you are high open with Quality Time, you might ask your colleague to try a new coffee place once a month. <strong>When you get to know yourself, you know what makes you happy, what to ask for, and how to have smooth interactions.</strong></p>
			<h4 class="x05-Head-B">#2: Them</h4>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Now comes the fun part! I love to guess other people’s appreciation languages. It helps me understand how to make them happy and gauge what our relationship will be like.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">As with personality rankings, I always prefer a direct approach like this:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-First"><strong>As a Conversation Starter:</strong> “Have you ever heard about the 5 Love Languages? I’m reading this book about it and was curious if you had heard of them.” Then you can get into a great conversation about which they think they are. I love to try to guess my friends’ and colleagues’ and have them guess mine.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Last"><strong>Quiz:</strong> We have a free appreciation language quiz on our website that you can send to a partner or friend and ask to share results. Find this at www.ScienceofPeople.com/toolbox.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_164" title="164"/>If you don’t feel comfortable with the direct approach, you can use behavioral evidence to decode someone’s appreciation language.</p>
			<h5 class="x05-Head-C">What They Do For You</h5>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">The easiest way to know how someone likes to be treated is to see how they treat their favorite people.</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-First">Do they love to come around your office and hang out together? (Quality Time)</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Are they leaving little notes all over the house for you? (Words of Affirmation)</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Do they touch your arm during conversations and hug instead of shaking hands? (Physical Touch)</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Do they volunteer to make your favorite dessert for your birthday instead of ordering something premade? (Acts of Service)</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Do they bring little trinkets home from their travels to give you? (Gifts)</li>
			</ul>
			<h5 class="x05-Head-C">Discussion Questions</h5>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Another decoding method is to ask about old memories, favorite stories, and recent experiences. These are some of my go-to questions:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-First">What’s the nicest thing someone has ever done for you?</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">How do you celebrate your successes?</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">I really want to do something nice for our colleague who just had a new baby. What do you think we should do for them?</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">What’s your favorite thing to do on the weekends?</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">What’s the most interesting gift you have ever received? Given?</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">What’s your favorite activity to do with your friends?</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Last">Growing up, what did your parents do to celebrate your birthdays or your successes?</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">These questions can be surprisingly revealing. If you ask a non-gift-giver about the best gift they have ever given, they might tell you about something they <em>did </em>for someone else or a letter they <em>wrote </em>to someone else.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">I recently asked one of my friends this question. He said the best gift he ever gave was writing his grandmother’s life story in a handmade book for her. I instantly guessed his primary and secondary appreciation <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_165" title="165"/>languages—Words of Affirmation and Acts of Service. He was a great sport and agreed to confirm my guesses with my online quiz. Sure enough, those were his two.</p>
			<h5 class="x05-Head-C">Decoding Microexpressions</h5>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Microexpressions can greatly help you in uncovering appreciation languages.</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-First"><strong>Anger:</strong> Getting the wrong form of appreciation can be tiring or downright aggravating. For example, an employee who enjoys gifts might be disappointed at a grand office party thrown in his honor. Why? He didn’t want to burden his colleagues with a party. He would have been way happier with a gift card or that new snowboard he has been talking about.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted"><strong>Happiness:</strong> A genuine happiness microexpression clues you in when you’ve truly delighted someone—whether they really like your idea, gift, or praise, or if you’re not speaking their appreciation language.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted"><strong>Contempt:</strong> Contempt is a clue that someone feels disconnected from your method of appreciation. For example, someone who doesn’t like physical touch might betray a half smirk when you try to hug them.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Last"><strong>Disgust:</strong> Remember that disgust is the microexpression we show when we are trying to think of a polite way to say we don’t like something. Get someone a gift they don’t like or suggest a quality time experience that they are not into, and they will flash disgust before they answer.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Spotting these microexpressions is only half the battle—how you respond is just as important. How can you use appreciation languages to get on the same page? That’s step #3.</p>
			<h4 class="x05-Head-B">#3: Us</h4>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Dr. John Gottman and Dr. Robert Levenson were looking for patterns in relationship happiness when they interviewed couples about their personal histories, arguments, and family life.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber79" id="SuperscriptNumber79"><sup class="endnote">7</sup></a></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">At the end of these interviews, Dr. Levenson went back over the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_166" title="166"/>transcript to see which pronouns each couple favored. <strong>He found that the couples who used more “I, me, mine” had lower rates of relationship happiness and satisfaction than the couples who used more “we, our, us.”</strong><a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber80" id="SuperscriptNumber80"><sup class="endnote">8</sup></a></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Dr. Gottman calls this pattern the we-ness versus me-ness mentality split. “Couples with a high degree of ‘we-ness’ emphasized their ability to communicate well with each other. They also emphasized unity and togetherness as well as having the same beliefs, values, and goals in life.” On the other side of the spectrum, couples who used more “me,” “I,” and “my” in their responses had self-oriented goals and long-term ideals. Not surprisingly, these couples were less happy in their marriages.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber81" id="SuperscriptNumber81"><sup class="endnote">9</sup></a></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">While Gottman and Levenson were focused on romantic relationships, the same principle applies to all of our relationships. This is where the Appreciation Language hack can really help you level up. When you know the appreciation languages of people in your life, you switch into the “we-ness” mentality. You begin to think about how your needs are being met <em>and</em> how you can best meet theirs.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Below are some ideas for how you might honor different appreciation languages in small ways that feel natural. For each language, write the name of someone in your life you suspect speaks it dominantly.</p>

			<p class="x14-Free-Style-1"><strong>Example Person</strong>: ________________</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">There is one thing I want to mention about physical touch in the workplace: <strong>Proceed with caution</strong>.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">From a nonverbal perspective, touch is wonderful for rapport, but you have to make sure you are keeping it appropriate. A good rule of thumb is to know that the farther up the arm you go, the more intimate the touch becomes. And the head and trunk are considered intimate zones.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><span class="_2-Figure-Callout"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_169" title="169"/></span></p>
			<div class="w80c">
				<img alt="" class="w100" id="image_pageMap_169" src="../image/83_Touch_Map_rev2.jpg"/>
			</div>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><strong>Zone One Touch</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Handshakes</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Fist bumps</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">High fives</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="x07-List-Head"><strong>Zone Two Touch</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Back-of-the-hand tap</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Forearm touch</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Shoulder touch</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="x07-List-Head"><strong>Zone Three Touch</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Hug</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Back pat</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Last">Arm over the shoulder</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Hopefully it goes without saying that with physical touch, it is important to follow your workplace etiquette. If you are unsure if your touch is welcome, pay attention to microexpressions as you move through the zones. For example, start with a handshake and see if you get a genuine <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_170" title="170"/>smile. Next time you meet, give a handshake and a shoulder touch—still smiling? Notice any contempt or anger? Finally, you can try the hug if you feel comfortable and they don’t show any negative facial gestures.</p>
			<h3 class="x05-Head-A">BONUS: DON’T BE BORING</h3>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Hey! I brought you a pen from my trip to Niagara Falls. We should hang out some time. Honey, I did the laundry.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">These are all nice, but they are also boring, predictable, and expected. In Hack #3: Conversational Sparks, I talked about escaping the average and creating dopamine with the unexpected. I want to challenge you to do the same for the Appreciation Language hack.</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-First">Don’t get Gifters standard presents—get them something personally meaningful. Leslie Knope, the beloved blond <em>Parks and Recreation</em> character played by Amy Poehler, installed an automatic door closer for her boss Ron and creates “Galentine” gifts for each of her female friends every Valentine’s Day.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Don’t invite Quality Time people to do boring activities. Forget coffee—ask them to go on a hike or to a grilled cheese shop. My friend Stephen Scott is a triathlete, and he asks people to go on walks or runs in lieu of the typical lunch.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Have a physical touch partner or friend? Learn how to give massages or do reflexology. Samantha Hess is a professional cuddler who has created an entire business around the physical touch love language. She has created over seventy-one cuddle positions and claims to be a master cuddler—yes, really. In the name of research, I even booked a session with her and filmed it for my YouTube channel—it ended up being both awkward and informative, to say the least! (Watch the full video at www.ScienceofPeople.com/toolbox.)</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">You can always write a thank-you note, but can you jazz it up a little? On NBC’s <em>The Office</em>, Jim Halpert draws the name of his not-so-secret crush, Pam Beesly, in Secret Santa. He writes down all of their favorite memories and inside jokes and puts them in a teapot. Well played.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">I have an Acts of Service friend who constantly overworks herself. So I send her funny videos to watch during lunch and make her <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_171" title="171"/>custom playlists on Spotify to listen to while she drives. Last time she was sick, I made her a little care package with my special vegetable juice blend (the only thing that cures a cold), cough drops, and chicken noodle soup.</li>

			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The bonus part of this challenge is to ask one of the most powerful questions for any relationship:</p>
			<p class="x06-Extract-A-1P">What is one way I can show you more appreciation?</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">This is the question that consumes Paige on a daily basis. As she builds ClientJoy boxes and handwrites thank-you notes (to cover those who also love Words of Affirmation), she remembers certain presents that rocked her world as a child. When her dad returned to their home in rural southwest Missouri after work trips, he’d bring her and her five siblings bizarre gifts, like XXL T-shirts from a canceled Disney show. “It didn’t matter. We were thrilled to get something,” she told me.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Now, as an adult, she sees a grander meaning behind gifting: “I hope that with each gift box people feel that someone, somewhere really cares <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_172" title="172"/>about them, whatever the reason is. Gifting is about appreciation. And appreciation is how we build real connection.”</p>

			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Appreciation is the key to life and job satisfaction. We can hack connection by using the five appreciation languages. Know what you need, learn what the people around you need, and find ways to show them you care.</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-First">Learn and stand up for your primary and secondary appreciation languages.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Use the second level of the matrix to decode appreciation languages of the people you meet.</li>

			<h2 class="x03-Chapter-Subtitle">How to crack someone’s personality</h2>
			<p class="x03-CO-Body-Text"><span class="_idGenDropcap-1">I</span>n 1984, Procter &amp; Gamble, once the go-to brand for everything from soap to paper towels to vegetable oil, was thrown into crisis by the creeping encroachment of rival companies.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber63" id="SuperscriptNumber63"><sup class="endnote">1</sup></a></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Something had to change. Out of the blue, Richard Nicolosi, a shift foreman at Procter &amp; Gamble, was approached by a P&amp;G marketing executive about joining their team. “I didn’t even know how to spell marketing at the time,” said Nicolosi. But executives recognized his unique ability. They hoped his engineering mind could solve some of the company’s biggest problems.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Nicolosi began doing what he knew best as a chemical engineer: solving puzzles. He applied this methodical way of thinking to his dealings with people, too. “<strong>Getting the best out of people is like solving a puzzle,</strong>” Nicolosi explained to me.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He was given authority to carry out a massive reorganization and began dismantling division teams and assigning new leadership roles. But he knew he couldn’t assemble new teams from scratch based on nothing but résumé printouts. He believed the key was to assign the right person to the right team in the right category.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Nicolosi had to find the best matchups, and find them fast. He developed a rigorous process that he still follows today. First, he sits down with each person and uses probing, insightful questions to seek to understand them. He both watches and listens—looking for body language tells, facial expressions, and behavioral traits.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Second, he spends time with them—and not two arms’ lengths <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_127" title="127"/>removed. He tries to see them in action. “There is a world of difference between what people say and what people do,” said Nicolosi.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Third, he listens to the words they use and then speaks their language back to them. This allows him to align what he wants to accomplish with what they want to accomplish.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Armed with this intel about each of his employees, Nicolosi set up effective teams and new workflows that carried the company out of the 1984 slump and through many crises in years to come. By the end of 1988, profits were up 68 percent.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Nicolosi began to teach his philosophy of people to many of P&amp;G’s other leading businesses: soaps, detergents, cleaning products, and soft drinks. He was the youngest-ever sector president, youngest-ever group vice president, and the youngest-ever corporate vice president. Eventually, he was asked to restructure Scott Paper, where he was able to double both operating profit to $700 million and increase return on investment to 23 percent in less than two years.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">When I asked Nicolosi what his secret was, he replied: “People come in a host of flavors, and understanding what flavor they are—and therefore what their hot buttons are—is necessary to lead and motivate them.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Nicolosi solves people puzzles, and so can you.</p>
			<h3 class="x05-Head-A">SOLVING THE PEOPLE PUZZLE</h3>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">I used to find people intimidating. I couldn’t keep personality differences straight. And I found it impossible to figure out behavior—let alone predict needs. Why did one friend love to chat while another never called me back? Why did some bosses encourage an open-door policy, while others used their secretary as a gatekeeper?</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Then, one day, I stumbled upon something called the five-factor model. This psychological principle posits that all humans have five basic personality traits: openness, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism (easily remembered as OCEAN). And each and every person ranks either high or low for each trait. Here’s a summary: <a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber64" id="SuperscriptNumber64"><sup class="endnote">2</sup></a></p>
			<p class="x07-List-Unnumbered-First"><strong>Openness:</strong> This trait reflects how you approach new ideas. It also describes how curious you are, your level of creativity, and how much you appreciate variety and originality.</p>
			<p class="x07-List-Unnumbered-Subentry"><span class="Semibold-Italic"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_128" title="128"/>High:</span> Enjoys novelty, change, and adventure.</p>
			<p class="x07-List-Unnumbered-Subentry"><span class="Semibold-Italic">Low:</span> Savors traditions, routines, and habits.</p>
			<p class="x07-List-Unnumbered-First"><strong>Conscientiousness:</strong> This trait describes your approach to getting things done. It measures your self-discipline, organization, and reliability.</p>
			<p class="x07-List-Unnumbered-Subentry"><span class="Semibold-Italic">High:</span> Loves to-do lists, organization, and schedules. Enjoys digging into the details and making things “perfect.”</p>
			<p class="x07-List-Unnumbered-Subentry"><span class="Semibold-Italic">Low:</span> Typically prefers big ideas and strategy. Might find lists and schedules stifling and overwhelming.</p>
			<p class="x07-List-Unnumbered-First"><strong>Extroversion:</strong> This trait describes how you approach people. Do you get energy from social situations, or do they drain you? This probably affects your talkativeness and optimism.</p>
			<p class="x07-List-Unnumbered-Subentry"><span class="Semibold-Italic">High:</span> Gets energy from being with people. Tends to be cheerful and seeks out social time.</p>
			<p class="x07-List-Unnumbered-Subentry"><span class="Semibold-Italic">Low:</span> Craves alone time and finds being with people draining.</p>
			<p class="x07-List-Unnumbered-First"><strong>Agreeableness: </strong>This trait describes how you approach cooperation and working with others. It also speaks to how empathetic and quick to forgive you are, and how much attention you pay to the mental states of others.</p>
			<p class="x07-List-Unnumbered-Subentry"><span class="Semibold-Italic">High:</span> Easy to get along with, very empathetic, and enjoys caring for others.</p>
			<p class="x07-List-Unnumbered-Subentry"><span class="Semibold-Italic">Low:</span> More analytical, practical, and skeptical—prefers to keep emotions out of decisions.</p>
			<div class="w30c">
				<img alt="" class="w100" id="image_pageMap_128_0" src="../image/72_OCEAN.jpg"/>
			</div>
			<p class="x07-List-Unnumbered-First"><strong>Neuroticism: </strong>This trait describes how you approach worry. It also explains how emotionally reactive you are to your environment.</p>
			<p class="x07-List-Unnumbered-Subentry"><span class="Semibold-Italic">High:</span> Tends to be a worrier. Frequently experiences mood swings.</p>
			<p class="x07-List-Unnumbered-Subentry"><span class="Semibold-Italic">Low:</span> Typically calm, stable, and has very little mood fluctuation.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">These traits gave me a starting point. I began to “solve” each of the important people in my life by looking at their behavioral patterns. For fun, I created small ciphers for each person, like this:</p>
			<div class="w30c">
				<img alt="" class="w100" id="image_pageMap_129_1" src="../image/73_Boss_OCEAN.jpg"/>
			</div>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Then I would guess, based on their choices, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_129" title="129"/>attitudes, and behaviors, where they fell in each category. Here was one I made for my boss at the time:</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">I came to call each of these little ciphers a matrix. After a few weeks of making a matrix for everyone in my life, something interesting happened. I noticed that many of my relationships and conversations were beginning to change.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">First, my conversations were flowing much more smoothly. I finally had a guide for easy banter—I just asked people questions that helped me solve their matrix. For example, I was no longer anxious when I ran into my boss in the break room. When trying to figure out if he was high open (likes trying new things), I asked about his most recent vacations and then his career path. This led to a great rapport, and, eventually, his asking me to grab lunch “to continue this great conversation.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Second, I was arriving at a much deeper and more accurate understanding of the people in my life. Once I learned my boss was a low extrovert (preferred to work and brainstorm alone), I got in the habit of sending him my ideas before our office meetings so he could review them on his own time—he always got back to me first and prioritized my ideas.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Finally, I was getting faster at decoding new personalities. After only a few minutes of chitchat, I could guess how someone would rank. When I met my boss’s wife, I was able to instantly connect with her by asking about her favorite restaurants. Her answer helped me predict which topics of conversation she might enjoy most, leading to a lively discussion over drinks.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Without realizing it, I was following Nicolosi’s guide to figuring people out. I was asking purposeful questions. I was listening and watching for behavioral clues. Then, I was using their individual cipher, or personality matrix, to predict and optimize for their behavior.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">This led me to one of my most powerful people hacks: speed-reading. Before you learn to master it yourself, let’s talk about where personality comes from.</p>

			<h3 class="x05-Head-A">PERSONALITY SCIENCE</h3>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Researchers have long been interested in personality, but it wasn’t until the 1980s that Dr. Lewis Goldberg cultivated the first major breakthrough, finding that the five-factor model, which Dr. Goldberg nicknamed “the Big Five,” was the most accurate.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber65" id="SuperscriptNumber65"><sup class="endnote">3</sup></a> Since then, the Big Five has been used as the standard in academia and has been found to be more reliable than Myers-Briggs, DiSC, or Enneagram personality measures.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Personalities play a huge role in how we make decisions, form goals, and balance work and relationships. And we usually can’t control them. About 35 to 50 percent of your personality is wired into your genetic makeup. Your upbringing, another factor you have zero say in, also shapes you considerably.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Ever wish your colleague was more organized? Ever try to make your partner less of a homebody? Ever try to calm your friend down from worrying so much? This never works! We can’t alter people’s nature. Instead of trying to change the people in your life, learn how to decode, optimize, and predict their behavior.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">First, let’s start with a self-assessment.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber66" id="SuperscriptNumber66"><sup class="endnote">4</sup></a> Be as honest as you can:</p>

You belong in the middle if you can see yourself having both high and low qualities at different times. For example, those who fall in the middle of the extroversion scale are “ambiverts,” meaning some situations make them feel outgoing and others make them feel closed up. (This has a lot to do with your thrive and survive locations.) For our purposes, think of the personality you express the majority of the time. You might even limit your rankings to the way you feel professionally or socially, depending on your goals from this book.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">If you had trouble with these self-statements or feel all of your traits <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_134" title="134"/>are in the middle, you might need to take the official forty-four-question personality test to verify your rankings.<span id="footnote-014-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink" href="42_Footnote_12.xhtml">*</a></span></p>
			<h3 class="x05-Head-A">SPEED-READING THE MATRIX</h3>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">By the end of 2014, our lab was booming. I was swamped with new projects, my speaking calendar was completely full, and we had just enrolled over 40,000 students in our online courses. We needed help.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Luckily, three new interns were starting in our lab. I couldn’t wait to get more hands on deck. Everything started out peachy. By their fourth day, the interns were helping manage our active social media accounts.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">About two weeks in, we hit a snag. One of the interns—I’ll call her Eva—was struggling to complete tasks. No worries, I thought, I’ll just send her more-detailed instructions.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">But the following week, her incomplete projects were still backing up the rest of my team. No worries, I thought, I’ll check in with her and ask her what she’d personally prefer to work on. Over lunch, we sat down together and I suggested some new projects she might like. She was on board! We were looking good.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">A week later, I found out she hadn’t even started on the tasks we’d talked about. No worries, I thought, I’ll just pair her with an older team member as a mentor.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">A week later, Eva sent me an e-mail saying she wanted to quit. I was flummoxed: What went wrong?</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The answer was simple: I had failed to decode her matrix. I was interacting with Eva according to my personality traits, not hers. Since then, I have developed a system for solving someone’s matrix.</p>
			<p class="x06-Extract-A-First">HACK #7: Speed-Read</p>
			<p class="x06-Extract-A-Last">Use the matrix to solve people’s Big Five personality traits.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Speed-reading is a three-step hack—first you must decipher your own personality, then quickly figure out the person you are interacting with, then decide whether to compromise or optimize.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">I have taught this method to over 12,500 students all over the world. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_135" title="135"/>We have had over 18,000 people take our personality test in our lab. Of all of the people hacks I teach, this is the one I get the most excited e-mails about.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Speed-reading is a relationship game changer. When used correctly, it clears up miscommunications, prevents arguments, spices up chitchat, and accelerates bonding.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><strong>While speed-reading is one of my most powerful hacks, it is also extremely advanced. </strong>If you have to read this section a few times, do it. If this hack takes you a little longer than others, embrace it. If it’s a little out of your comfort zone, do a little energizing jig and keep moving forward. I promise, it will change your relationships.</p>
			<h4 class="x05-Head-B">Step #1: You</h4>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Decoding your own matrix is the first step to speed-reading.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Based on your scores earlier in this chapter, fill out the blank matrix below. Put a down arrow next to the traits you rank low in, an up arrow in the traits you rank high in, and an equal sign on the traits where you fall in the middle.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><strong>Special Note:</strong> Some people find their personality traits are slightly different personally or professionally. If this is you, feel free to mark these two areas of your life in separate colors.</p>
			<div class="w30c">
				<img alt="" class="w100" id="image_pageMap_135" src="../image/75_OCEAN_Me.jpg"/>
			</div>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Here is my matrix and explanations to give you an idea of how self-decoding works. Put your answers next to mine.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">My matrix was almost the opposite of my intern Eva’s. This is one reason we had such a hard time getting along. I tried to impose my personality onto her—and that never works out well:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-First">I am high open, so I’m incredibly curious and love experimenting. I assumed Eva would also like being assigned fun new tasks at work and learning new skills. I picked her projects based on what I would have wanted, not what she would have wanted.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">I am high conscientious so I love details, plans, and to-do lists. I kept sending Eva more details in the hope they’d reassure and guide her.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_136" title="136"/>I am a high neurotic, so I’m overly eager to make sure everyone on my team is happy. I was constantly checking in on Eva—which made her feel pressured.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Last">I am medium agreeable and medium extroversion, so I like working with people in the right circumstances—or in my thrive locations. I did not take Eva’s into account.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">This approach didn’t work—<strong>in fact, it was a selfish way to interact.</strong>  I was seeing Eva through my personality instead of optimizing for hers.</p>
			<h4 class="x05-Head-B">Step #2: Them</h4>
			<div class="w30c">
				<img alt="" class="w100" id="image_pageMap_136" src="../image/76_OCEAN_Intern.jpg"/>
			</div>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">I realized a little too late that I was not using Eva’s matrix. Upon receiving her e-mail, I quickly pulled out a sheet of paper to decode her personality—which I should have done when I first hired her.</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-First">Eva is low open, so she was overwhelmed by my flood of suggested projects.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Eva is low conscientiousness, so my long, detailed e-mails intimidated her. She did not know how to start—so she didn’t start at all.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Eva is highly agreeable, so she said yes to all my questions and projects, even though they scared her a bit. She was afraid to mess up the team flow or disappoint me, but wasn’t sure how to make it work.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Eva is a low extrovert, so pairing her with a mentor <em>and</em> putting her on a team of three new interns thrust her into a survive scenario. Worse yet, she was uncomfortable asking for help.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Last">Eva is a medium neurotic, so she had trouble understanding my worry and got a little frustrated with my constant check-ins.</li>
			</ul>

			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Begin to practice guessing the personality traits of people you meet. I highly recommend the direct approach for this. I frequently ask new friends, new hires, and new colleagues directly about their personality traits. This is the easiest and most straightforward way to decode someone’s matrix. Here are a few strategies:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-First"><strong>As a Conversation Starter:</strong> “I’m reading this book about the five personality types—have you ever heard of them?” If they have, great—ask where they rank. If they haven’t, explain each one and guess each other’s on the spot.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted"><strong>As a Game:</strong> “Hey, friend! I just stumbled upon this personality test at ScienceofPeople.com/personality. Here are my scores. I would love to see yours!” You can use this direct approach with new hires and partners as well. People love taking quizzes!</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted"><strong>As a Formal Process:</strong> These days, I make it a point to formally give the personality test to each of my interns the week they start. This also produces great office conversation.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted"><strong>As a Virtual Process:</strong> There are many tools online that can also help you decipher people’s personality traits. The University of Cambridge created a free tool called Apply Magic Sauce that will scan your Facebook profile for cues to your personality using your posts, pictures, friends, and communication patterns as indicators.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Last"><strong>As a Communication Process:</strong> A tool called Crystal<span id="footnote-013-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink" href="43_Footnote_13.xhtml">*</a></span> uses your e-mail history and people’s LinkedIn profiles to give you suggestions on their Big Five personality needs and how to communicate with them. For example, when I e-mail my colleague Danielle, it gives me e-mail templates on how best to communicate with her based on her personality and ideas on how to work well together:</li>

			<h5 class="x05-Head-C"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_138" title="138"/>The Speed-Reading Approach</h5>

			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">If you don’t have time to directly ask people about their personalities—or feel you can’t—you can speed-read them. You’ll crunch data from their body language, verbal cues, and behavior to decode their personality matrix. <strong>Every hack I have taught you so far was building up to this one. </strong>As you speak with someone, listen for verbal cues and look for nonverbal clues. For example:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-First">Asking an introvert, “Do you know anyone else here?” might make her nervous so that she flashes fear.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Encouraging a low open friend to try a new restaurant or order something different might make them irritated so that they flash an anger microexpression at you.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Last">Pitching a low conscientious client with a long, detailed proposal might overwhelm them so they flash contempt when you hand them a large packet.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_139" title="139"/>You can also use clues to decipher personality with what researcher Sam Gosling calls behavioral evidence. In a series of fascinating studies, Gosling analyzed participants’ personal belongings, rooms, and cubicles to deciper their personality types.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber67" id="SuperscriptNumber67"><sup class="endnote">5</sup></a> Using his findings, here is a list of casual questions to help you gauge personality traits, plus behaviors that are reliable personality evidence.</p>

			</ul>
			<p class="x07-List-Head"><strong>Behavior:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted"><strong>High:</strong> This is a great way to find out if someone goes to new places, restaurants, and tends to travel—or has the desire to experience more new things.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted"><strong>Low:</strong> If someone goes to the same vacation spots or restaurants every year or prefers to stay home, they could be low open.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="x07-List-Head"><strong>Clues:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Highs might have knickknacks from trips scattered around their living space and post pictures of exotic food on social media.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Highs have diverse taste in books and music.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Highs are very inquisitive.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Lows have lots of routines and habits.</li>

			</ul>
			<p class="x07-List-Head"><strong><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_140" title="140"/>Behavior:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted"><strong>High:</strong> Highs usually know exactly what’s coming up in their lives, and will typically be much more descriptive about upcoming projects, as if they’re reading off a to-do list.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted"><strong>Low:</strong> Lows are much more easygoing. They might have difficulty making plans. They want to “play it by ear,” “see how it goes,” and “go with the flow.”</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="x07-List-Head"><strong>Clues:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Highs usually put great care into their appearance and property.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Highs often have alphabetized bookshelves, a personalized filing system, and a detailed planner.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Interestingly, Sam Gosling also found that they tend to have good lighting in their rooms.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Lows are usually the ones to ask to borrow a pen, forget to charge their phones, and tend to show up a little late. This also doesn’t bother them much—after all, “it’ll all work out in the end.”</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Lows tend to let the laundry go until they’re down to the last pair of underwear.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">A low might not notice a messy desk covered with stacks of papers and unopened mail.</li>

			</ul>
			<p class="x07-List-Head"><strong>Behavior:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Though a low might know just as many people as a high, highs might want to know more about the people around them and make a point to “work the room.”</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted"><strong>High:</strong> Typically, an extrovert will want to spend more time with people, and won’t need recovery time between social activities. Alone time might not be essential to them.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted"><strong>Low:</strong> An introvert might have fewer social events planned—or might intersperse people activities with solo activities.</li>

			<p class="x07-List-Head"><strong><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_141" title="141"/>Clues:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Highs tend to smile more often and more broadly, as they tend to be more optimistic.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Highs engage more comfortably with big groups of people and often stand with broad, confident body language.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Highs love sharing details of their life and accomplishments with others. They reach out more often via text and use more words in e-mails.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Lows prefer one-on-one conversations.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Lows prefer to bond with others in quiet environments, or to do activities that don’t require talking at all.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Sam Gosling found that extroverts have more decorations in their offices or cubicles because they want to make their spaces more inviting. In other words, they set out trinkets, games, and candy to lure people in. Interestingly, this does not apply to their bedrooms!</li>

			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">What do you want for dinner?</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Are you usually the peacemaker? (This question can come up naturally. For example, if talking about siblings, ask if they were the troublemaker, the goofball, or the peacemaker. When talking about friend drama, ask if they’re usually the one stuck in the middle.)</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Want to join us later? (This question can also help you gauge extroversion.)</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="x07-List-Head"><strong>Behavior:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted"><strong>High:</strong> Agreeable people typically default to a yes, so they will usually respond with something like, “Sure, whatever everyone else is doing!” or “What did you have in mind?”</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted"><strong>Low:</strong> Low agreeable people typically default to a no. They will often turn down all your suggestions before weighing the pros and cons of a decision themselves.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="x07-List-Head"><strong>Clues:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">According to Sam Gosling, highs tend to have a more relaxed walk with more arm swinging.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_142" title="142"/>Highs take the world’s problems on their shoulders. They want to help, fix, and care for everyone in their life—and sometimes this means they don’t take care of themselves.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Lows are less driven by emotions than facts. Cooperation is less important to them than being right, or simply getting to the right answer.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Lows don’t want to know how you <em>feel </em>about something. They want to know what Google says.</li>

				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted"><strong>Low:</strong> Low neurotics have a higher capacity for stress and difficulty, so even if they are busy, their <em>attitude </em>toward their busyness will be less anxious.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="x07-List-Head"><strong>Clues:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">According to Gosling, high neurotics tend to have more self-help quotes and inspirational messages in their office space and homes. They use them to self-calm and self-regulate.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Highs usually have <em>one more thing</em> they want to tell you, just in case. They’re planning and preparing for every eventuality.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">According to Sam Gosling, high neurotics tend to wear darker colors of clothing.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">High neurotics are good at <em>preventing</em> crises. They think through every possible what-if scenario so they’re prepared for the worst.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Low neurotics are great to have around during a crisis—they can think clearly, stay calm, and act as everyone’s rock.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Last"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_143" title="143"/>Lows typically think about what’s going right instead of what’s going wrong.

			<h5 class="x05-Head-C">Ethical Speed-Reading</h5>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Three final points to keep in mind while speed-reading:</p>
			<ol>
				<li class="x07-List-Numbered-First" value="1"><strong>Speed-reading is about empathy.</strong> Even attempting to speed-read someone gets you leagues ahead in the people game. Solving people’s matrices requires asking intentional questions, listening deeply, and trying to connect with someone on their terms. We want to be solved—it makes us feel heard and understood.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Numbered"><strong>There is no “best” or “normal” personality orientation.</strong> When you assign people trait labels, do so with no assumptions about what’s “right” or “wrong.” My goal is to help you diagnose and honor <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_147" title="147"/>someone’s natural tendencies and find out who someone really is, not who you want them to be. When you accept and optimize for who someone really is instead of trying to change or judge them, your interactions become much deeper, your conversations become smoother, and you are better able to predict behavior.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Numbered"><strong>Personality traits are not stereotypes.</strong> Don’t let assumptions about someone’s gender, race, or age block your ability to accurately decode someone. This is just one more reason to abandon any and all prejudice—it never helps you get along with or decode people.</li>
			</ol>
			<h4 class="x05-Head-B">Step #3: Us</h4>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Once you have begun decoding someone’s personality, begin thinking about which of your traits are complementary and which put you in conflict.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">When your traits match, awesome. You’ll typically have smooth and well-balanced communication. When they don’t match, you have two options: You can optimize or you can compromise.</p>

			<p class="x04-Body-Text">I experience the compromise-optimize decision on a daily basis with different personalities in my life. For example, I am high in conscientiousness and my husband is low. I love for the sock drawer to be organized by color, shape, and occasion. My husband doesn’t care if he is wearing two different socks, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles’ shells, or bonsai trees on <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_148" title="148"/>his feet. We tried to optimize—I attempted to teach him my method of advanced sock organization. This lasted precisely two days. Now we have two separate sock drawers on opposite sides of the closet. This has saved us a lot of headache.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Here’s how the compromise-optimize method might have worked with Eva:</p>
			<p class="x07-List-Unnumbered-First"><strong>Openness:</strong> We are opposites on the openness spectrum.</p>
			<p class="x07-List-Unnumbered"><strong>Optimize:</strong> Instead of assigning her new learning projects, I should have looked at her previous work history on her résumé and assigned her projects to build on her existing skill set—not start her on a totally new track.</p>
			<p class="x07-List-Unnumbered-First"><strong>Conscientiousness:</strong> We were also opposites in conscientiousness.</p>
			<p class="x07-List-Unnumbered"><strong>Compromise:</strong> Since Eva was low in conscientiousness, I should have emphasized the big goals of each project, and then given her freedom to try tasks on her own before bombarding her with details.</p>
			<p class="x07-List-Unnumbered-First"><strong>Extroversion:</strong> As a low extrovert, Eva prefers to work on her own. In-person meetings are too overwhelming for her. I should have sent her work assignments in writing before our meetings.</p>
			<p class="x07-List-Unnumbered"><strong>Optimize:</strong> It would have been no hassle for Eva to work on projects solo instead of sitting with the other interns. I also should have asked her to take our Science of People tutorials before her in-person training. She needed time to prepare questions and learn at her own speed.</p>
			<p class="x07-List-Unnumbered-First"><strong>Agreeableness:</strong> Yet another reason to have more e-mail contact and fewer in-person meetings was Eva’s level of agreeableness. She so wanted to please her new manager and coworkers.</p>
			<p class="x07-List-Unnumbered"><strong>Optimize:</strong> Instead of sitting down together for weekly reviews, I should have arranged a more formal written review where she could give me feedback. She needed a safe space to state needs and set boundaries.</p>
			<p class="x07-List-Unnumbered-First"><strong>Neuroticism:</strong> As a high neurotic, I was freaking Eva out with all of my worries. She took it personally that I seemed to be micromanaging her.</p>
			<p class="x07-List-Unnumbered-Last"><strong><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_149" title="149"/>Compromise:</strong> Even though I can’t be less of a worrier (I wish!), I could have let Eva know that my check-ins were nothing personal. She had no idea that I do the same with everyone on my team. And I could have minimized her frustration by standardizing their timing (every Friday afternoon, for example), so she would’ve known what was coming.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">In sum, my difficulties with Eva were probably preventable. But it’s nice to know that wrinkles like these can easily be ironed out in the future.</p>
			<h4 class="x05-Head-B">Bonus: The Personality Advantage</h4>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Knowing someone’s personality gives a tremendous boost to your persuasive powers. Whether you are pitching an idea to a client or trying to convince your partner to choose your favorite restaurant for dinner, you should tailor your pitch to their personality. This will not only make your pitch more likely to succeed, but also will make the entire process more enjoyable.</p>
			<p class="x07-List-Head">Openness <strong>Advantage</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted"><strong>High</strong>: If you know you are pitching a high open person, lead with all the exciting new benefits and give them time to brainstorm ideas with you.</li>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Subentry"><span class="Semibold-Italic">Personal:</span> “I have heard this Indian fusion place combines ingredients that we’ve never tried before!”</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Subentry"><span class="Semibold-Italic">Professional:</span> “This new water system will give you better water pressure, a lower water bill—and new shower heads are included!”</li>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted"><strong>Low</strong>: If you’re pitching a low open person, lead by describing what you’re <em>not </em>changing. Then present a rational, evidence-based case for your new idea to help them overcome their apprehension about trying something new.</li>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Subentry"><span class="Semibold-Italic">Personal:</span> “I know they still have our favorites, naan and saag paneer, but they do a new take on chicken tikka, which might be good. They have great reviews on Yelp.”</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Subentry"><span class="Semibold-Italic">Professional:</span> “This system is easy to put in—you won’t have to change water companies or do anything different with your water meter. Our clients say they didn’t notice any change except suddenly having great water pressure.”</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="x07-List-Head"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_150" title="150"/>Conscientiousness <strong>Advantage</strong></p>

			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted"><strong>High</strong>: A highly conscientious person will want to hear a long, in-depth proposal without missing details. Be prepared for lots of questions.</li>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Subentry"><span class="Semibold-Italic">Personal:</span> “I think we should go to Hawaii. For one, the flights are direct, and we’ll have all kinds of activities within reach. I went ahead and put together a list of ways to spend time on the Big Island. Here’s a sample itinerary I printed and a basic budget of what we need to save up.”</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Subentry"><span class="Semibold-Italic">Professional:</span> “I have prepared a twenty-page document of each phase. Let’s review it together and then I can answer all of your questions.”</li>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted"><strong>Low</strong>: A low conscientious person is most interested in your executive summary or brief overview. You’ll want to give a short, punchy synopsis—the details would only bore them.</li>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Subentry"><span class="Semibold-Italic">Personal:</span> “Hawaii is the most cost-effective option with the most activities for the kids. It should cost ___ dollars.”</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Subentry"><span class="Semibold-Italic">Professional:</span> “Let me give you the three most important points of this proposal and the immediate next step.”</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="x07-List-Head">Extroversion <strong>Advantage</strong></p>

			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted"><strong>High</strong>: An extrovert is listening for social proof in a pitch—what do other team members think? They also won’t mind an impromptu group brainstorm session.</li>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Subentry"><span class="Semibold-Italic">Personal:</span> “Okay, everyone! What do we want to do for New Year’s? Any ideas? I hear that a bunch of people are going to see Pink Martini at the Crystal Ballroom—thoughts?”</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Subentry"><span class="Semibold-Italic">Professional:</span> “I am going to throw some ideas on the board for our next work retreat. Call out whatever you have in mind and then we can vote.”</li>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted"><strong>Low</strong>: An introvert won’t like being put on the spot for questions. They’d prefer to have time to review your proposal on their own before making a decision.</li>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Subentry"><span class="Semibold-Italic">Personal:</span> “Hey, what did you have in mind for New Year’s? Want to start a text chain with some ideas? Let me know if you come up with anything.”</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Subentry"><span class="Semibold-Italic"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_151" title="151"/>Professional:</span> “I want us all to start thinking about the work retreat in the summer. Please send me your suggestions so I can do a quick e-mail poll.”</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="x07-List-Head">Agreeableness <strong>Advantage</strong></p>

			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted"><strong>High</strong>: A high agreeable person might say yes to your face, but no later on. They typically want to avoid confrontation and protect everyone’s feelings—which might make them hesitant to bring up the real issues on their mind.</li>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Subentry"><span class="Semibold-Italic">Personal:</span> “Are you sure you’re okay? I know this is awkward to talk about, but it is really important that I know how you feel. Tell me whatever’s on your mind.”</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Subentry"><span class="Semibold-Italic">Professional:</span> “I’m going to pause at the end of each section to get everyone’s thoughts. Trust me, you won’t offend me—be sure to bring up all of your concerns. At this stage, it’s best to get everything on the table.”</li>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted"><strong>Low</strong>: A person who is low agreeable might be skeptical of your claims until they get their hands on evidence. Be prepared for tough questions!</li>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Subentry"><span class="Semibold-Italic">Personal:</span> “Before you say anything, let me explain my side of the story and tell you what happened. I think it will make sense in context.”</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Subentry"><span class="Semibold-Italic">Professional:</span> “I am going to go through the entire presentation—so please hold your questions until the end. I’ve saved plenty of time for Q and A after we cover everything.”</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="x07-List-Head">Neuroticism <strong>Advantage</strong></p>

			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted"><strong>High</strong>: A high neurotic likes to hear that <em>you’re</em> worrying about everything for him. In other words, to keep a neurotic calm, convince them you’ve thought about and solved every potentiality so they don’t have to. This builds trust. Pro and con lists help show you have thought about both sides.</li>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Subentry"><span class="Semibold-Italic">Personal:</span> “I know you’re worried about what we should do. I think we should move. But let’s sit down and make a big pro and con list together. We should discuss backup plans, too.”</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Subentry"><span class="Semibold-Italic">Professional:</span> “Let’s begin with the safeguards built into our proposal. If anything is late or something doesn’t work, we’ve built in time cushions and have extra staff on standby.”</li>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted"><strong><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_152" title="152"/>Low</strong>: A low neurotic isn’t as concerned with what-ifs, so bringing them up could worry them unnecessarily. Within reason, they will take your word for it. So do your due dilligence, mention you did your due dilligence, and leave it at that.</li>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Subentry"><span class="Semibold-Italic">Personal:</span> “I’ve thought long and hard about it and I’m sure we should move. If you’re on board, I’ll talk to the Realtor and keep you informed on my progress.”</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Subentry-Last"><span class="Semibold-Italic">Professional:</span> “We also know that unexpected snags are a possibility, and our staff is well equipped to handle any hiccups. I can assure you of that.”</li>
			</ul>

			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Different personalities require drastically different approaches—and this is a good thing! When you cater to people’s unspoken preferences, you put yourself way ahead of the curve.</p>
			<h4 class="x05-Head-B">Speed-Reading Challenge</h4>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Like learning to read, learning to speed-read doesn’t happen overnight. The best way to get good is to practice with people you know and always review past experiences.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Go through the following challenge. If you forget a trait, use the Personality Cheat Sheet in our Digital Bonuses.</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-First">Start identifying the personality traits of people in your life by putting an equal sign or up or down arrow in each column below. Leave the space blank if you aren’t sure.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Highlight or circle the traits where you match.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Name some of your relationship or communication challenges. Are they related to personality differences?</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Can you optimize or compromise on any of these issues?</li>
			</ul>

			<p class="x04-Body-Text">As you complete the challenge for people in your life, you might notice some interesting patterns.</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-First"><strong>Geography:</strong> Depending on where you’re located, you might notice a high concentration of traits or personality patterns. Since a large part of personality is genetic, we see blooms of traits in certain areas. We also know that culture exerts a strong influence on traits. For example, Southern California and New York City are hubs of entrepreneurship, adventure, and living in the moment. Not surprisingly, more high open people live in these areas, so these areas attract more high open people to them.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted"><strong>Self-Selection:</strong> I tend to get along better with high conscientious friends because they show up on time and are easier to plan with. In this way, I self-select my friends and favor certain personality types. You, your boss, and your friends might have similar personality types because that helps you get along and understand each other. Don’t be surprised if the important people in your life have similar matrices.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Last"><strong>Workplace Culture:</strong> When I was giving a presentation at Intel, an audience participant noted that Intel attracts and hires people with similar personality traits—typically high conscientious introverts. Certain corporations can attract a specific mix of personality types. A creative agency might hire high open, high extrovert <em>Mad Men</em> types, whereas a highly technical boss might hire and retain highly conscientious and highly agreeable employees. Your workplace might have people with similar matrices because they have either been hired by the same person or your corporate culture attracts a certain kind of individual.</li>

			</div>

			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_154" title="154"/>Deciphering matrices is an enjoyable process. In the words of Richard Nicolosi, “I discovered that my real love was not marketing, but getting a visceral sense of who people are and what they want and why. It became my passion to get into other people’s mind-set.” Now it’s time for you to hack into other people’s mind-sets to help them—and you—succeed.</p>

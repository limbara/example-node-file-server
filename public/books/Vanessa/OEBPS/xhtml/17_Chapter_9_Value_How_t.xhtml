			<p class="x03-CO-Body-Text"><span class="_idGenDropcap-1">B</span>oyd Varty and his family own and operate Londolozi, one of the best luxury safari camps in South Africa, perennially ranked as one of the top one hundred hotels in the world. His guests have high expectations. Some expect the height of extravagance in the middle of the wild African bush. Some want to see the full cornucopia of wildlife Londolozi has to offer. Varty’s challenge is to understand his guest’s idea of a perfect vacation, and deliver it seamlessly. The only problem? Londolozi is located in one of the most dangerous and inhospitable private game reserves in South Africa.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I’ve also discovered that people have more phobias than you would ever imagine: buffaloes, worms, feathers, spiders, insects, loud noises, skulls, teeth, dung—any or all of which are very likely encountered on a game drive,” Varty wrote in his book <em>Cathedral of the Wild</em>.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber82" id="SuperscriptNumber82"><sup class="endnote">1</sup></a></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Over breakfast Varty told me about one particular guest that called on all of his experience.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber83" id="SuperscriptNumber83"><sup class="endnote">2</sup></a> Martin, an elderly British gentleman, had previously been on safari more than a dozen times in exotic locations around the world. He told Varty he had saved the best for last, and that this would be his final safari. Wanting to live up to the expectations of a safari aficionado, Varty decided he would personally take Martin on his game tour to ensure everything went according to plan. Unfortunately, Varty and Martin would both encounter an unpleasant surprise.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">On the second day of cruising around in an open-air Land Rover, Varty spotted some leopard tracks. He departed the vehicle on foot to investigate, leaving Martin in the safety of the vehicle until he returned. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_174" title="174"/>Martin hadn’t been alone for long when a huge male bull elephant came trotting out of the brush to inspect the vehicle—and Martin.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Martin hoped the elephant would get bored and walk away so he remained as still and silent as possible. All of a sudden the two-way radio installed in the roofless Land Rover started crackling with traffic between other drivers on the property. The elephant became rattled and then agitated as the radio continued to blare. Soon the elephant began pounding his trunk on the hood of the Rover and started spraying it with dirt.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Eventually the elephant stalked away, but when Varty returned he found Martin white-knuckled, ashen faced, and furious that he had been left to fend for himself in the face of a house-sized pachyderm. Martin bellowed from the back of the truck, “I’m very angry with you! Take me back to the camp!”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">For the next two days, Martin refused to talk to Varty—but insisted on completing his last few game drives. “I tried everything I could to win him back over the next couple of days, but he would have none of it,” said Varty.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Then Varty had a fresh idea. Martin thought of himself as an adventurer. What if Varty could redefine his experience as a feat of daring? Calling in some favors, Varty asked all of the ladies in the camp to go up to Martin and congratulate him on being brave enough to stare down that big bull elephant all on his own. Bingo!</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“In no time Martin began to feel like he was the main man, even to the point where he began to expound on the story to any person who walked past the bar. By the time he left Londolozi, he felt like the king of Africa,” said Varty. Martin told Varty at the end of the trip that his elephant encounter would be his greatest memory.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber84" id="SuperscriptNumber84"><sup class="endnote">3</sup></a><span id="footnote-015-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink" href="46_Footnote_16.xhtml">*</a></span></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Varty’s genius move was to tap into Martin’s ideals. I call this finding someone’s primary value.</p>
			<h3 class="x05-Head-A">THE SCIENCE OF VALUE EXCHANGE</h3>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">In Africa, I learned that animals give and take what they need to survive. Humans are not so different.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_175" title="175"/>Social psychologist Dr. Uriel G. Foa discovered the resource theory of human relationships.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber85" id="SuperscriptNumber85"><sup class="endnote">4</sup></a> <strong>He argues that all interactions are actually transactions. </strong>That people cooperate simply to give and take resources from each other. “A resource is defined as anything that can be transmitted from one person to another.”<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber86" id="SuperscriptNumber86"><sup class="endnote">5</sup></a></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><strong>Special Note:</strong> When I talk about “transactions” here, I’m not insinuating that all intimate relationships are actually cold and businesslike. Many transactions are aimed toward finding people who truly fulfill us and building relationships that are mutually beneficial.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Resources include physical items like money and food as well as emotional resources like love, advice, and status. As humans, we need both kinds of resources to survive and thrive.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber87" id="SuperscriptNumber87"><sup class="endnote">6</sup></a> Foa and his research team proposed that each of us have a hierarchy of six needs that originate in our childhood. If these needs are met, we are able to grow up, gain independence, and feel secure in our surroundings and relationships:</p>

			<p class="x04-Body-Text">In the Give column, put a check mark next to the resources you think you give frequently. In the Take column, put a check mark next to the resources you think you take frequently.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">We both <em>give</em> each of these resources and <em>take </em>them during interactions. For example, we might buy a friend lunch to ask for their advice (giving Money and taking Information). Or we might give a colleague praise after they help us finish a project on time (giving Status and taking Service).</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">We need all six of these resources, but we typically take what we need <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_176" title="176"/>more of and give what we have in abundance. Looking at your selections, is this true for you?</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Occasionally, especially with the nonphysical resources like Love, Service, and Information, <strong>we give what we most want</strong>. We might crave Love, so we give it to everyone around us—even if they don’t deserve it. Or we might desire to be in the know, so we gossip in hopes of people telling us more. Does this ring true for you?</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">This exchange of resources is a core dynamic of every relationship. Misunderstandings here can cause needless tension, even breakups. Here’s why:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-First"><strong>Power:</strong> Foa argues that power can be measured as the amount of resources you have to give others. Having a lot of Money is obviously an element of power, but having a lot of Love to give others is also an element of power.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted"><strong>Needs:</strong> We can use resource theory to better meet people’s needs. If you need to motivate a colleague, for example, you’d best consider whether they value Information—learning, applying new job skills, and maybe even insider knowledge—or Status—getting respect, a high title, and esteem from peers—or whether they’re just in it for the Money—a higher salary, bonuses, and financial incentives.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Last"><strong>Security: </strong>Relationships become more difficult when there’s consistently an unequal exchange of resources. Anxiety, guilt, and resentment bubble up. We all know a romantic relationship is doomed when one person gives more Love and begins to feel resentful. Meanwhile, the person doing all the taking might feel smothered. You can even understand workplace tensions in these terms: When a factory foreman gives the resource of Money to her employees, she expects employees to give back the Goods they make in the factory. If the boss doesn’t pay enough, employees get angry. If employees don’t produce enough, the foreman gets angry.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Whether we are in personal or professional environments, establishing equilibrium in our relationships is essential. However, other people’s resource needs might not always be what you expect.</p>

			<p class="x06-Extract-First-No-Space">One day, a man was walking down the street with his eight-year-old daughter. They turned a corner and saw a little boy sitting next to a large wicker basket. He held a sign that said, “Puppies 4 Sale.”</p>
			<p class="x06-Extract">Before the man could stop his daughter, she ran up to the basket and clutched a tiny dog to her chest. “Oh dear, I’m in trouble,” he thought.</p>
			<p class="x06-Extract">He turned to the boy, “Son, how much does this puppy cost?”</p>
			<p class="x06-Extract">“Well, sir, this puppy is the best, most adorable puppy in the entire world. He costs one thousand dollars,” the little boy replied.</p>
			<p class="x06-Extract">“One thousand dollars!” the man exclaimed. “That’s crazy! Now, be reasonable and give me a better price and I’ll buy this puppy from you.”</p>
			<p class="x06-Extract">“Sorry, sir, this puppy is the best in the world. It is one thousand dollars,” the boy said.</p>
			<p class="x06-Extract">The man haggled with the boy for another twenty minutes, but he wouldn’t budge on the price. The man decided he would have a much better negotiating position if he came back without his daughter, who was crying hysterically.</p>
			<p class="x06-Extract">The next day, the man returned without his daughter, and sure enough, the boy was still sitting with his wicker basket and a napping puppy inside. The man said, “Well, well, well, looks like no one has taken you up on your offer of one thousand dollars for that puppy. Now that you have had a day to think about it, can you cut me a better deal?”</p>
			<p class="x06-Extract">“No, sir, the puppy is still one thousand dollars because it is the best puppy in the entire world,” the boy said.</p>
			<p class="x06-Extract">After another ten minutes of negotiations, the man left empty-handed. A few weeks later, the man saw the boy playing basketball with his friends on the local playground. He called over, “Hey, kid! Did you ever sell that puppy?”</p>
			<p class="x06-Extract">The boy trotted over. “I sure did!” he said.</p>
			<p class="x06-Extract">The man was surprised. “Really? Did you sell it for one thousand dollars?”</p>
			<p class="x06-Extract-Last"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_178" title="178"/>“Yes!” he replied. “A girl traded me two five-hundred-dollar kitties.”<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber88" id="SuperscriptNumber88"><sup class="endnote">7</sup></a></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">This parable demonstrates that <strong>value is in the eye of the beholder</strong>.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">We typically think of valuable assets in terms of their monetary value, but there are other, more subjective currencies. To the little boy, two five-hundred-dollar kitties were much more valuable than ten hundred-dollar bills. Which leads me to this simple and intuitive hack: When you know what drives someone, interactions become much easier.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Each of us is oriented toward one of the six categories of resources. I call this a primary value, and it is the last layer of the matrix.</p>

			<p class="x04-Body-Text">We wanted the diaries to be done on the go, so they had only enough room for essential pieces of information. In the first column, participants entered a brief description of the event. We wanted to know if it was romantic, professional, familial, or social. The second column asked for a single symbol:</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“+” means it was an overall good experience.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“=” means it was only ok.</p>

			<p class="x04-Body-Text">At the end of the seven days, our researchers coded the diaries for patterns. We were looking for syntax changes, feeling repetitions, and word usage after each type of event. We then compared these notes to each participant’s Big Five personality traits.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">It was quite easy to predict extroversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and neuroticism based on a participant’s notes. Openness was <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_180" title="180"/>the only pesky one we found harder to detect. But the most interesting part of this experiment was the discovery of people’s primary values.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Until this experiment, my matrix had only two layers—personality and appreciation language. This research added the final layer. We noticed that each person’s notes focused on one resource, whether to complain about its absence or to extol its presence.

If they didn’t get it, it was a negative interaction.</p>

				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-First"><strong>Filling a Missing Need:</strong> Foa and his team argue that we often try to seek from others what we have been denied earlier in life. For example, someone who didn’t grow up in a loving household may seek Love, validation, and belonging from their friends and colleagues later in life. They might become people pleasers in their desperation to feel liked. Or someone who grew up short on Money might cut coupons and haggle over a few cents at garage sales even after they have plenty to pay the bills. It’s hard to feel sated when the memory of resource deprivation is old and ingrained.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted"><strong>Finding What We Lack:</strong> We also tend to seek out what we can’t provide ourselves. If someone has low self-esteem, they are more likely to seek the Status resource from others. We all know someone who incessantly posts selfies on social media. They need likes, comments, and shares to feel good about themselves.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Last"><strong>Giving Us Purpose:</strong> Researcher Dan P. McAdams at Northwestern University studied our self-narratives—the stories we tell ourselves <em>about</em> ourselves.

			</div>

			<p class="x04-Body-Text">My professional primary value is Information. I’m constantly teaching and reading every book, blog, and study I can get my hands on. My social and romantic primary value is Love. I did not feel very liked or accepted growing up and never had a great group of friends in school. As an adult, I am incredibly lucky. I finally have a wonderfully supportive partner and loving friend group. But I still consistently try to give Love and take Love with these important people.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">You can write your own answers in the middle of your now completed matrix along with your personality rankings and appreciation language.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">There’s a reason your value language belongs right at the heart of the matrix. Tapping into your values is one of the most powerful things you can know about yourself and the people around you. Why? <strong>Knowing your primary value is the key to contentment.</strong></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Want to know why you’re in a funk? Your primary value isn’t being met. Want to know why a relationship isn’t working for you? It’s probably a value misalignment. Want to understand why you made a poor choice? Your primary value was driving you in a different direction.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Many of my students say that decoding their own matrix was just as <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_184" title="184"/>powerful as learning how to decode others’. <strong>Our primary value is at the heart of who we are, the choices we make, and what drives us.</strong></p>
			<h4 class="x05-Head-B">#2: Them</h4>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Here’s a nice, fat human behavior truth for you: <strong>Most people’s choices make sense to them. </strong>When they don’t make sense to you, it’s usually because you are being driven by a different primary value.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Knowing primary value differences with the people in your life can help explain:</p>
			<ol>
				<li class="x07-List-Numbered-1-First" value="1">Why some people drive you absolutely crazy</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Numbered-1">Most relationship misunderstandings</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Numbered-1-Last">Unpredictable choices and behavior from the people you care about</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Do you need to motivate someone at work? Tap into what they value. Do you need to understand a partner’s baffling choice? Figure out how it met their value needs. Want to know what gets someone up in the morning? Decode their primary value.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Killer social skills require seeing the world through someone’s lens besides your own. <strong>Appeal to someone by focusing on what they value, not what you value.</strong></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Be warned: I think uncovering someone’s value language is the most difficult layer of the matrix. I use three tactics:</p>
			<ol>
				<li class="x07-List-Numbered-1-First" value="1"><strong>Complaints and Brags:</strong> Does someone complain about not being paid enough at work? (Money) Not being recognized for an achievement? (Status) Not having a nice enough car? (Goods) Or do they brag about how they took care of a sick parent? (Service) How much the new boss likes them? (Love) How much they know about the new corporate partner? (Information) We’re usually proud of obtaining our primary resource and upset about not having enough of it. This comes out in boasts, grumbles, and brags.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Numbered-1"><strong>Nonverbal Cues: </strong>Body language can also help you figure out if you are tapping into or refusing someone’s primary value. Think of our good friend Mario. When he gets a Fire Flower or Super Mushroom, he jumps into the air, gets bigger, or runs faster. But when he hits a Koopa shell or a Goomba, he shrinks or loses a life. It’s the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_185" title="185"/>same in real life (minus the overalls and mustache). When someone gets a primary value met, they are delighted! Watch for genuine happiness microexpressions, leans, nods, and winner body language. When someone does not get their primary value met, they show disgust, anger, contempt, or defeated body language.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Numbered-1"><strong>Behavioral Cues:</strong> Once you start looking for it, someone’s behavior can tell you a lot about needs they are trying to fill. Here is how this might look in the workplace:</li>
			</ol>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Subentry2">Colleague A always stays late to suck up to the boss. You can tell they’re constantly looking for praise or more responsibility. Their primary value might be Status.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Subentry2">Colleague B leaves promptly every day at five p.m., but always gets their projects done in time for the raise review. They are the first to ask about year-end bonuses. Their primary value might be Money.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Subentry2">Colleague C is an office butterfly, making friends with colleagues and leaving supportive notes on people’s desks. Their primary value might be Love.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Subentry2">Colleague D always remembers people’s birthdays, loves to plan office parties, and always organizes the corporate softball team. Their primary value might be Service.</li><li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Subentry2">Colleague E desperately wants the corner office and the best parking space in the lot. They love all the corporate perks and never forget to bring everyone souvenirs from vacations. Their primary value might be Goods.</li><li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Subentry2">Colleague F is a bit of an office gossip, so they always know what’s going on behind the scenes. They also play golf with all the partners. Their primary value might be Information.</li>
			</ul>
			<ol>
				<li class="x07-List-Numbered-1-Start-4" value="4"><strong>Worries: </strong>What keeps someone up at night? What do they stress out about? This can clue you into their primary value. Do you have a friend who is constantly moaning about feeling out of the loop? Her primary value might be Information. Do you have a colleague who freaks out over people’s titles and is always stressing about who will get the next promotion? His primary value might be Status.</li>
			</ol>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Subentry2">Listen to the kinds of things someone worries about.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Subentry2">Ask them what they worry about or the biggest worries in their life.</li><li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Subentry2">Match it with a primary value.</li>
			</ul>

			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_186" title="186"/>These can be hard to pick up on at first, but analyzing someone’s past behavior can help point you in the right direction toward their primary value.</p>

				<div class="Fast-Fact">
					<p class="x09-Box-Title">FAST FACT BOX</p>
					<p class="x09-Box-Text-Last">We asked over 1,000 participants what they worry about—the answers are very evenly distributed. Why? Our unique primary values inform our different kinds of worries.</p>

			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><strong>Special Note:</strong> I love the direct approach, but primary values are hard to talk about honestly. Most people who are driven by Money are ashamed to admit it—even though this is a legit and necessary resource. Others feel embarrassed to say that they need to be liked or please people. Be aware that what someone says about their value language might not match the way they actually behave.</p>
			<h4 class="x05-Head-B">#3: Us</h4>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Once you think you know someone’s primary value language, what do you do with that information?</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">First, your predictions about their future behavior and choices will improve. This is extremely helpful when trying to decide how a colleague will perform on a new project or if someone would be a good potential romantic partner.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Second, you can use it to motivate the people in your life. Want to encourage your child to do more chores? More allowance might not be the best option. Want to impress your boss? Support their primary value, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_187" title="187"/>not yours, with the behavior <em>they</em> will appreciate. Want to incentivize your teammate to do better? Give more of what they value and take less of what matters most to them.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Lastly, you can adopt a primary value to help people feel worthy. I think the greatest gift we can give our fellow human beings is to meet their resource needs. If I can give someone more of their primary value, I always do.</p>

			</ul>
			<p class="x14-Free-Style-3"><strong>Example Person</strong>: ________________</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The best way to harness the power of primary values is to give the right resource right away. For example, one of my good friends, John Boylston, ran for state representative in Oregon. He reached out to a mutual friend of ours, Matthew Scott, about a campaign coordinator opening. (Thank you to both of them for letting me use this example.)</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">John wanted Matt’s help, but was also hoping to make it a win-win <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_189" title="189"/>interaction. I have a hunch John’s professional primary value is Service. He needed help with coordinating his entire campaign—calling donors, making fliers, knocking on doors, and answering phones.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Before reaching out to Matt, John had to figure out Matt’s primary value. Was Matt’s primary value Money—would he want to get paid hourly? Was it Status? Did Matt want to be listed on his website and campaign materials? Was it Information? Would Matt want to get an insider’s view into politics? After talking to a few friends in our circle, John found out that Matt had been wanting to get experience running a political campaign. Guessing that Matt’s primary value was Information, here’s how John reached out via e-mail (edited slightly for length):</p>
			<p class="x06-E-mail-Salutation">Hi Matt,</p>
			<p class="x06-E-mail-Text-First">I heard that you were thinking about getting more involved in politics and potentially helping out on a campaign, is that right?</p>
			<p class="x06-E-mail-Text">If so, I think you would be an awesome fit for a project that I’m working on. This spring I am going to run for state representative for House District 26. When I run I will need a good campaign team around me. I have already gathered a team of professional consultants, fundraisers, a data manager, and compliance and accounting individuals. What I really need, though, is someone who can be director of voter contact and volunteer manager.</p>
			<p class="x06-E-mail-Text">This is more than the entry-level volunteer position and I think it could be a chance for you to get inside a campaign and really see how campaigns work while also getting to make decisions, be creative, and do more than stuff envelopes (though we will have to pitch in on that stuff from time to time).</p>
			<p class="x06-E-mail-Text">I would be able to guide you through this, and we have an awesome team coming together who will help as well. So, we will have tons of support for you, but I need someone who can be the engine for the campaign when it comes to making sure that we’re actually talking with voters.</p>
			<p class="x06-E-mail-Text">As I was setting up my team, you were the first person I thought of for this job and I think you would be awesome at it.</p>
			<p class="x06-E-mail-Closing-2">—John</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_190" title="190"/>Later, I learned that Matt was ecstatic to get this e-mail from John. It was exactly what he had been wanting. He replied right away:</p>
			<p class="x06-E-mail-Text-1P">I’d absolutely love to help out in any way, shape, or form and this sounds like something that I’d be very interested in for sure. I believe my weekends and nights are usually fairly calm, with the exception of I’m out at a trade show, so those times would work great for me. Thank you so much for thinking of me for this position and I’d love to help out. When would be a good time for you to meet so we could talk through everything? Once again, thank you so much!</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">To put this in perspective, <strong>Matt thanked John for asking him to work for free</strong>. At first glance this seems counterintuitive, but if you know that Matt’s primary value is Information, it makes sense. Matt wanted to know more about running a campaign and was happy to join for an insider’s look. This e-mail was the start of a powerful working relationship because both men had their primary values being met.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><strong>Special Note:</strong> Some of my students have found the need to occasionally add a situational value. This is when someone’s primary value is different in a specific situation. For example, you might know that a colleague’s primary value is Money. However, you notice that projects where he takes the lead, he craves praise, recognition, and likes to claim credit: a situational value of Status.</p>
			<h4 class="x05-Head-B">The Hunt for the Heart</h4>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">One of Boyd Varty’s biggest challenges arrived when a king decided to visit Londolozi. “We’ve had our share of visiting celebrities, dignitaries, and politicians . . . but handling this royal entourage would require an unprecedented level of coordination,” recalled Varty.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber90" id="SuperscriptNumber90"><sup class="endnote">9</sup></a></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Not only did major logistics have to be taken care of—like extending a small runway to accommodate royal jets—but Varty had to figure out what would make His Highness’s experience special.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Luckily, Varty and his team got their clue right away—Goods seemed paramount to the king and his entourage. By talking to the king’s staff, Varty learned that the princesses enjoyed shopping. “Our small gift shop had to be hugely overstocked so that the royal retinue of twenty women accompanying the king could discover fresh merchandise should they choose to shop once, twice, or three times a day.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_191" title="191"/>The Varty team flew in the king’s Clarins face wash, his favorite vibrating workout machine, and papaya hand lotion. By the day of the king’s arrival, Londolozi had been totally customized to his primary value.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Aside from the natural beauty of their surroundings, this basic human insight is how Boyd Varty and his family have turned Londolozi into a world-renowned resort. Varty taps into primary values every day, with every person he meets—whether a safari guide, front desk concierge, or cook. He can quickly discern whether someone is on safari for the luxury experience (Service), the all-inclusive five-star dining (Goods), or a sense of oneness with nature (Love).</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">At the end of the day, Boyd is hunting for heart. He is searching for ways to bring meaning to the people who come to Londolozi. Your goal as a hacker is to do the same thing. Hunt for people’s values, hunt to give them meaning, hunt for heart.</p>

			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Interactions are about transferring resources to each other. There are six categories of resources that we give and take with each other. We are driven by one main category, also known as your primary value. Each of us has a primary value that drives our behaviors, actions, and decisions. Hacking into someone’s primary value is the final step to decoding them.</p>

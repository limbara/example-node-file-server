			<h2 class="x03-Chapter-Title">EMPOWER</h2>
			<h2 class="x03-Chapter-Subtitle">How to lead people</h2>
			<p class="x03-CO-Body-Text"><span class="_idGenDropcap-1">Y</span>ou would think Mark Gordon’s illustrious career as a film producer is enough for a lifetime. He’s won Oscars and Emmys. He’s worked with Hollywood’s top celebrities, from Tom Hanks to Matt Damon to Sandra Bullock. But he’s also a hero—albeit unsung—in the world of education.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Gordon first took on increasing responsibilities in the private schools his two daughters attended. Then he became chairman of Teach For America Los Angeles. Then, in 2010, Gordon had an idea—and it wasn’t a small one. He wanted to create a school that shaped kids into global citizens. This was a tremendous undertaking—especially coming from someone who knew little about schools. Would the leadership skills he’d developed on movie sets translate into this new setting?</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">When I sat down with Mark Gordon, he summed up his leadership approach in three steps: “I always start with something I am passionate about, outline one goal, and then find a really smart, capable person to work with.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The passion was there. And a daunting goal was set: Open a charter school by September 2010. This would give him nine months to find a location, form an education charter, hire teachers, enroll students, and create a curriculum.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The third part of the equation was Kriste Dragon. Gordon met Dragon while she was executive director of Teach For America. As a Juris Doctor, former math teacher, and mom of three, Dragon had the right experience and perspective.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I called her and told her: I want to start a school and I’ll pay for the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_213" title="213"/>whole thing. How do we do it and how do we do it fast?” recalled Gordon. Instead of being overwhelmed, Dragon was hooked immediately. “My mom was an immigrant and my dad grew up in the projects outside of Birmingham, Alabama, so diversity and inclusion have always been something that mattered to me,” said Dragon.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The duo hammered out a mission together: “We hoped to create a tuition-free school that was incredibly racially, economically, and intellectually diverse. We also wanted to foster sophisticated thinkers who have a deep sense of service,” said Dragon.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Within a few weeks, Citizens of the World Charter School was born. But they had just a few months to get the school ready for kids. Eager to shield her from the work of drawing donations or forming committees, Gordon encouraged Dragon to use her talents. “I told her to build a team, find her ideal location, and tell me exactly what she needed,” said Gordon.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Dragon internalized Gordon’s philosophy in her own hiring process. “Get the right people, connect them to something bigger than themselves, and let them do their thing,” said Dragon. She found the right principal, assembled an outstanding teaching team, and located the perfect spot for their flagship location in East Los Angeles.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">When Citizens of the World Charter School opened up applications for their fall class, they received hundreds of applicants and had a full class starting in September 2010.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“The reason we were able to do so much, so quickly was due to Mark’s leadership style. He is very clear on the goal, he knows my skills, and he lets me run with them. I couldn’t ask for a better partner—he gives me the resources I need to solve problems and the freedom to solve them my way,” explained Dragon.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber98" id="SuperscriptNumber98"><sup class="endnote">1</sup></a><span id="footnote-017-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink" href="48_Footnote_18.xhtml">*</a></span></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">In 2012, Gordon and Dragon opened their second school in the Silver Lake neighborhood in California. Just a year later, they launched their third school in Mar Vista, and expanded to Brooklyn, New York, where two schools (in Crown Heights and Williamsburg) opened. Citizens of the World now has seven schools, serving over 1,850 students across three cities.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Slowly, Citizens of the World schools are empowering the next generation of leaders. And Gordon is a testament to the fact that if you are a leader <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_214" title="214"/>in one area, you are a leader in every area. His approach to people works whether he is influencing the film industry or the education system.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Gordon and Dragon are changing the world by empowering people. Now you can, too.</p>

			<h3 class="x05-Head-A">THE SCIENCE OF OWNERSHIP</h3>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Have you ever tried to build something from Ikea? If you’re like me, here’s what happens: First, you see a great-looking item in a perfectly designed room on the floor of Ikea. You fall in love! You snap a pic of the tag—because you’ll never remember the bizarre-sounding name—and burn 1,000 calories pushing a giant flatbed cart around stacks of identical-looking aisles. Once you have procured all twenty-seven pieces of wood for your item, you proceed to the checkout. You stop for a cinnamon roll.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Once you get home, you unload and unpack all twenty-seven pieces of wood onto your living room floor. The amount of discarded cardboard is staggering. You make small piles of nails, screws, himejababs, and plastic nubs. (I don’t know what a himejabab is, but it is what I call the tiny weird things Ikea gives you to build furniture.)</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">You are delighted to see only four pages of instructions—and there are pictures! Forty-five minutes into your assembly, you realize your starting piece is upside down. You throw it across the room. You get a glass of water and yell at your spouse. Five and a half hours later, your item is finished—wobbly, but finished.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Over the next few months, you watch as it slowly begins to disintegrate and then collapse when used or nudged. A friend suggests buying a new (preassembled) item from the store down the street. You are horrified—you invested eight hours of your life for this item, it will crumble into dust before you get rid of it.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">This delightful little experience is universal. We place a disproportionately high value on self-made products. And it is appropriately called the Ikea effect. Researchers Michael Norton, Daniel Mochon, and Dan <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_215" title="215"/>Ariely wanted to investigate this interesting phenomenon around ownership.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">They asked participants (builders) to make a small origami frog or crane. Then the researchers offered to buy their handmade creations from them, and asked how much of their own money the participants might pay for such an item.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The researchers then showed the origami to new non-builder participants and asked how much <em>they</em> would pay for it—they wanted to know how far above market price builders would pay for their own creations.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Finally, the researchers had expert origami makers create perfect cranes and frogs, and asked a final group of non-builder participants how much they would pay.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">As you might have guessed, “While the non-builders saw the amateurish creations as nearly worthless crumpled paper [worth less than 5 cents], our builders imbued their origami with more value [23 cents],” said the researchers.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The researchers also tested this using actual Ikea furniture and Lego creations—with the same results.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber99" id="SuperscriptNumber99"><sup class="endnote">2</sup></a> We love things that we have made because we see them as an extension of ourselves. This means we place a higher value on them.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">We can leverage this effect to empower those around us. Mark Gordon didn’t call Kriste Dragon and say, “Hey, I want to start a school and I want to do it my way.” From the beginning, he wanted Dragon to create a school with him. He gave her the financing and the support she needed, and then stepped back. <strong>When we give up control, we gift power.</strong></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">I call this hack: Own It!</p>
			<p class="x06-Extract-A-First">HACK #11: Own It!</p>
			<p class="x06-Extract-A-Last">Empower people by giving them buy-in, control, and ownership.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Leading people is about communicating a mission and then letting them take part in it. If you want to motivate a colleague, empower a team, or inspire a friend, all you have to do is figure out how to give them ownership.</p>
			<p class="x06-Epigraph">People appreciate directness and honesty. The best bullshit is truth because it’s totally disarming.</p>

			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Have you heard of the famous study about copy machines? It goes like this: In 1977, psychologist Ellen Langer at Harvard University wanted to hack the copy machine line.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Langer had her research assistants try to cut to the front of the copy machine line using three different lines:</p>
			<p class="x07-List-Unnumbered-First"><strong>Request #1:</strong> “Excuse me, I have five pages. May I use the copy machine?” (Request Only)</p>
			<p class="x07-List-Unnumbered"><strong>Request #2:</strong> “Excuse me, I have five pages. May I use the copy machine because I’m in a rush?” (Request + Logical Reason)</p>
			<p class="x07-List-Unnumbered-Last"><strong>Request #3:</strong> “Excuse me, I have five pages. May I use the Xerox machine because I have to make copies?” (Request + Silly Reason)</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Request #2 is the only request that makes any sense. Request #1 is nonsensical because the line is clearly to use the copy machine. Request #3 is also ridiculous—everyone in the line has to make copies.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The first request worked okay—60 percent of people let the researcher cut in line. The second two requests worked incredibly well. The logical reason persuaded 94 percent of people to move aside, and the silly reason got 93 percent of people to say yes!<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber100" id="SuperscriptNumber100"><sup class="endnote">3</sup></a></p>
			<div class="w100">
				<img alt="" class="w100" id="image_pageMap_216" src="../image/88_Completing_Favor.jpg"/>
			</div>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_217" title="217"/>Why are reasons—even illogical ones—so powerful? Humans are purpose-driven creatures. We want to believe there are reasons behind everything we do. <strong>Before leaders can inspire action, they have to get emotional buy-in.</strong></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">When we explain the motivations behind a goal, it allows listeners to feel partial ownership of that goal. Have you ever donated to a charity? Were you initially arrested by an emotional plea? Charities typically open a pitch by sharing their mission with you. Take my favorite nonprofit Kiva as an example. This is the first paragraph of the “About us” page on their website:</p>
			<p class="x06-Extract-1P">We are a nonprofit organization with a mission to connect people through lending to alleviate poverty. Leveraging the internet and a worldwide network of microfinance institutions, Kiva lets individuals lend as little as $25 to help create opportunity around the world.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Kiva wants you to know there is a purpose behind their actions, and they hope that their purpose will become your purpose.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">If it sounds like getting emotional buy-in might be hard, I have an easy trick for you:</p>
			<p class="x06-Extract-A-1P">Always use the word “because” when asking for something.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Because” implies purpose. Whether you are pitching yourself, trying to get a date, or convincing a friend to choose your favorite restaurant for dinner, you always want to have your why at the ready.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">We know from the copy machine example that even ridiculous reasons can successfully persuade people, but I want you to find powerful whys, like Mark Gordon’s passion for changing the future of education or Kiva’s goal of alleviating poverty. Here is how you can give your “because” more impact.</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-First"><strong>Tie to Them: </strong>The best “because” benefits the listener. What’s the payoff? What’s the end result? What’s the advantage? Think of L’Oréal’s slogan, “Because I’m Worth It,” which appeals directly to the customer’s needs.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted"><strong>Tie to You:</strong> If something means a lot to you, or would make you incredibly happy, harness that authentic passion to create a <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_218" title="218"/>powerful “because.” Gordon believes fervently in equality and diversity. He also has two young daughters whom he wants the best for. Even if those aren’t your own goals, hearing him speak is powerfully moving. Or think of the United States Marine Corps slogan, “The Few. The Proud. The Marines,” which shows what the marines stand for and their elite mission.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Last"><strong>Tie to Us: </strong>You can also tie your “because” to a mutual benefit, or the way something could help an entire community. When pitching Citizens of the World Charter Schools, Gordon underscores how raising future world leaders will make the world better for everyone. Of course, the schools help students and their families most directly, but they also benefit the world they will enter after graduation. Similarly, Apple’s “Think Different” slogan is an appeal to both the user and the world to challenge the status quo.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Always share a because, and when you can, tie it to as many emotional appeals as possible. You might even be able to check all three boxes. For example, in my online course The Power of Happiness I give three whys for people to buy—you will be happier, I will be able to fund more research on happiness, and we will all live in a more fulfilled and aware community.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Here’s how everyday requests could be improved by this hack:</p>
			<p class="x07-List-Unnumbered-First"><strong>Typical Request:</strong> We would love to have you as a customer.</p>
			<p class="x07-List-Unnumbered"><strong>Hacker Ask:</strong> We would love to have you as a customer because you will love our product and it will make you stronger/better/more awesome.</p>
			<p class="x07-List-Unnumbered-First"><strong>Typical Request:</strong> Let’s get Indian food for dinner.</p>
			<p class="x07-List-Unnumbered"><strong>Hacker Ask:</strong> Let’s get Indian food for dinner, because it’s delicious—and you mentioned you wanted to try something new!</p>
			<p class="x07-List-Unnumbered-First"><strong>Typical Request:</strong> Can I have your number?</p>
			<p class="x07-List-Unnumbered"><strong>Hacker Ask:</strong> Can I have your number? Because I think we could have a great time together!</p>
			<p class="x07-List-Unnumbered-First"><strong>Typical Request:</strong> Are there any aisle seats available on this flight?</p>
			<p class="x07-List-Unnumbered"><strong><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_219" title="219"/>Hacker Ask:</strong> Are there any aisle seats available on this flight, because I tend to get up a lot and don’t want to disturb the people around me?</p>
			<p class="x07-List-Unnumbered-First"><strong>Typical Ask:</strong> Would you mind helping with my résumé?</p>
			<p class="x07-List-Unnumbered-Last"><strong>Hacker Ask:</strong> Would you mind helping with my résumé? Because I am hoping to finally move out of my parents’ house, and your help would mean the world to me!</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Knowing your why starts with being <strong>mission driven</strong>. Simon Sinek calls it the “start with why” approach in his book of the same name. Kriste Dragon hires only teachers who believe in the Citizens of the World Schools mission. Mark Gordon works only on projects where he can tell a powerful story. Even when they’re action movies, Gordon said, “They are <em>about</em> something. They are big spectacles and they are certainly big popcorn movies. But they aspire to at least make the audience think in a very broad way.”<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber101" id="SuperscriptNumber101"><sup class="endnote">4</sup></a></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">If you want to get buy-in from people in any area of your life, you have to know your why: the mission that is driving the action.</p>

			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_220" title="220"/>The why is your launching pad for inspiration. You cannot empower people without knowing what drives you—because it will also be what drives your people.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><strong>Bottom Line:</strong> Give people emotional ownership over ideas, goals, and projects.</p>
			<h3 class="x05-Head-A">SKILL OWNERSHIP</h3>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">When Mark Gordon was creating the Showtime series <em>Ray Donovan</em>, he partnered with Emmy Award–winning writer Ann Biderman as the showrunner. “Ann Biderman and I worked very closely to develop the script together. She was incredibly collaborative. It was one of the most joyous experiences that I’ve had developing a piece of material,” said Gordon in an interview with <em>Fast Company</em>.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber102" id="SuperscriptNumber102"><sup class="endnote">5</sup></a></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Gordon knows how important it is to know not only your own skill set, but also the skills of the people you are working with. “I only work with people whose talent I have tremendous respect for. That way, when you are working with them they have as much of a chance of being right as you and you produce something really good,” explained Gordon.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">After working with Biderman on casting and the pilot, Gordon knew it was his time to step back and let Biderman run the show. “Once you’re on a clear path, my involvement is less, because she doesn’t need it. I look at cuts and share my thoughts, but we’re sailing smoothly,” said Gordon. In other words, <strong>let the right person use their skills and then step back.</strong></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">I call this process “skill ownership.” Every time someone uses their talents to accomplish part of a goal, they feel more ownership over that goal—and this makes them want to achieve it even more.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Say you’re in your best friend’s bridal party. The bride and groom—let’s call them Rachel and Brian—have asked you to spearhead pre-wedding activities and logistics for the bridesmaids and groomsmen. The wedding planner hands you a long list of items that need to get done, from grabbing ice for the rehearsal dinner to putting the flowers in water before the wedding.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The first step is to give everyone emotional ownership. You assemble everyone in the hotel suite and introduce yourself. “It’s so nice to finally meet all of you! The wedding planner just gave me a list of some things we could all help out with <strong>because </strong>Rachel and Brian are a little overwhelmed. I know <strong>our goal</strong> is to make this wedding as smooth as possible <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_221" title="221"/>for the bride and groom and get everything done so we can party up at the wedding.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">This ties in the goal (getting the list done) with both helping the couple and ensuring a good time for everyone on the wedding night. People nod and go around introducing themselves—great! You have everyone on board.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Next, you want to turn that emotional buy-in into action. Here’s what most people do, which doesn’t work:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-First">Can someone finish the table name cards? . . . Anyone, anyone?</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Who can go pick up the ice before the rehearsal dinner? . . . Please? Someone?</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Last">Who wants to assemble these frames and hang them? . . . Come on, guys! We all have to pitch in!</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Splitting up tasks this way is not the best way to encourage action. People might grudgingly say yes, but it will be like pulling teeth.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Instead of randomly delegating or hoping people will self-select, you want to divide the list by skills. <strong>This highlights people’s abilities so they feel capable, as opposed to burdened.</strong> To do this, use what I call Skill Solicitation. Skill Solicitation is when you ask people to self-identify based on capability:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-First">Is anyone good at _____?</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Do you know anything about _____?</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Last">I need someone who is strong with ______.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">For the wedding, it might go like this:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-First">Does anyone have nice handwriting? Great! Susie, would you mind finishing up the table name cards?</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Does anyone have a car here? Wonderful! Steve, would you mind picking up the ice before the rehearsal dinner tomorrow?</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Last">I need someone who is really handy—anyone good at fixing things? Thank you so much, Greg. Will you assemble and hang these picture frames?</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">This is not only a faster way to delegate, but it also lets tasks be skill oriented as opposed to duty oriented. Use this tactic on corporate teams, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_222" title="222"/>sports teams, with kids, with friends, and with family. Direct invitations can be as effective as open questions. For example, Mark Gordon knew Kriste Dragon had the right skill set, so he called her and asked her to use those specific skills to achieve his mission. Some other examples:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-First">Uncle Jim, you are so good at mixing cocktails—can you man the bar tonight?</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Rene, I know you are very good at nailing those cold calls—can you tackle this list tomorrow?</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Last">Julie, you always pick the best restaurants—do you want to plan the birthday dinner?</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Do you notice something else about these examples? They also secretly use Hack #4: The Highlighter. Skill Solicitation is a great way to emphasize someone’s strengths and use them toward a common goal.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><strong>Bottom Line:</strong> Focus on someone’s skills to turn their emotional buy-in into action.</p>

			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Leadership is not about doing or overseeing everything in a project. It is about getting involved in the right things and letting the right people handle the rest. “Real learning experience for me, to be able to know when to come in, and when to leave people alone,” explained Gordon.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber103" id="SuperscriptNumber103"><sup class="endnote">6</sup></a></p>

You can’t feel the need to just go over there and mess around <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_223" title="223"/>with stuff either because you can, or because you feel guilty, or because it’s expected of you,” said Gordon.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">This approach has been astoundingly fruitful for both Gordon and Rhimes. <em>Grey’s Anatomy</em>, one of the most popular shows on television, has received 174 nominations and has won 63 awards including Golden Globes and Emmys. Rhimes herself has won a Producers Guild award, a GLAAD Media Award, two Writers Guild awards and five NAACP awards. She has also gone on to be the showrunner for<em> Private Practice</em> and<em> Scandal</em> and executive producer for <em>How to Get Away with Murder</em>. <strong>When you give up control, you let other people take ownership, and everyone wins.</strong></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Now, I am not saying you should give up total control. Rather, I want you to think about how you can allow people to add their own flair. Researchers found that consumers are willing to pay a premium for products that they have customized.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber104" id="SuperscriptNumber104"><sup class="endnote">7</sup></a></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Kiva does an amazing job incorporating this ownership into their business. As discussed previously, Kiva is an organization that allows people to give interest-free microloans to entrepreneurs around the world. But they don’t just ask you to give money so they can dole it out as they see fit. Instead, they let you search a database of entrepreneurs so <em>you</em> can decide exactly where your loan goes and how it will be used.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">I donate to Kiva every year on my birthday, and I <em>love</em> the process of picking my entrepreneurs. Kiva uses the three steps of Own It! in their donation model:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-First">First, when I go to their website, I see a list of people I can “lend” to. Every person starts off with their why—to get emotional ownership. I see a loan to a bookstore in Guatemala will help them purchase a computer for logging sales. Or that Fatima in Lebanon will use her loan to buy more merchandise for her retail shop.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Then I get to use my skills and values. Female entrepreneurship is incredibly important to me, and entrepreneurship happens to be a talent of mine, so I tend to give to women-owned businesses. I enjoy reading the different revenue models and picking women I think have sturdy business plans.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Last">Last, I decide exactly how much of my loan goes to each entrepreneur. Talk about customization!</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_224" title="224"/>The more you can allow people to customize a process or implement their own strategy, the better their participation will be. Christine Day, CEO of Lululemon Athletica, didn’t realize this until she was neck-deep in the business of running a company. “I was a very bright, smart executive, but I think I majored in being right.” She realized that “being right” wasn’t the best way to motivate a team.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Day began to create spaces for employees to brainstorm and come up with their own solutions instead of being told what to do by upper management. “When I was trying to get other people to have ownership or engagement, it wasn’t about the telling, <strong>it was about letting other people come in to the idea and being purpose led</strong>,” said Day.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber105" id="SuperscriptNumber105"><sup class="endnote">8</sup></a></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Day wanted to create jobs where people were utilizing their skills and taking ownership of the company’s performance. And she believes this is the crux of her leadership ability: “That was so powerful for me to shift from having the best idea or problem solving into actually being the best leader of people.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Under Day’s leadership, Lululemon went from having 71 stores to 174, and took their revenue from $297 million to almost $1 billion.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber106" id="SuperscriptNumber106"><sup class="endnote">9</sup></a> Being a good leader is not about micromanaging—it is about empowering your team by letting them customize their work.</p>

			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">When Gordon began working on <em>Saving Private Ryan</em>, he did it because he loved the idea—not because he thought it would make a lot of money.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“<em>Saving Private Ryan</em> was a movie that was purely from my heart and that I worked on for a long time with Bob Rodat, the writer. And we were fortunate enough to have Steven [Spielberg] and Tom [Hanks] jump on <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_226" title="226"/>board. But that was not necessarily expected to be a big commercial movie, so when you can make something of it that is truly meaningful <em>and</em> it’s a commercial success, that’s the best thing of all,” said Gordon.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Gordon always hopes his movies will be big blockbuster successes, but they don’t have to be. “Movies like <em>The Details</em>, which we just finished and premiered in Sundance . . . and some of the other smaller pictures that we’ve done are all about love of film, and things that I just fall in love with. And those films have to be in a category where we say, <em>It’s not about the money on any level</em>. It’s all about feeling good about making something that we’re in love with. Very few people have the opportunity to do that, and I’m very grateful for that,” said Gordon.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Gordon’s success comes from the fact that he works only on projects he cares about. When he sits down to write a script, he begins with a subject he is fascinated by and explores it.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“The thing for me is: Am I emotionally engaged in the idea? Is there something special about it? Does it capture my imagination? So everything that I do is simply something that turns me on,” explained Gordon in an interview with the<em> Hollywood Reporter</em>.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber107" id="SuperscriptNumber107"><sup class="endnote">10</sup></a></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">If something captivates your imagination, your passion, your energy, it is much more likely to captivate the imagination, passion, and energy of others. And isn’t that what we are all here to do? I believe <em>everyone</em> is a leader in some way.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><strong>You can both solve people problems and empower people to solve problems.</strong></p>

			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Every week, strangers send him postcards divulging confessions they’ve been bottling up. In total, Warren has received over a million secrets, and every week he receives one thousand more. The flow is so constant that the walls of his house are lined with stacks of secrets.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Some of the secrets are funny. Like this one, which I’m sure you can relate to:</p>

			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Warren gets secrets about infidelity, depression, parenting, office politics, repressed fantasies, and friendships.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Warren never expected to be the landing pad for all of these truths. It all started in 2004. “I printed up three thousand postcards with my home address. On each postcard, I asked people to anonymously share a secret,” said Warren. He handed them out on the streets of Washington, DC. He posted them on bulletin boards in coffee shops, he hid them in books in the public library, and he left them in bathroom stalls.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">When I asked Warren about his expectations, he was not optimistic. “I had no idea if anyone would actually send me any back. I was going to be really happy if I got 365 back over the course of a year,” Warren told me. He didn’t have to wait for long. Within a few weeks, he had one hundred postcards. Fascinated by what people would share to a stranger, he turned them into an art exhibit. Eventually he began posting them on his blog, which he calls <em>PostSecret</em>. Over the course of a few years, the blog went viral.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">When I first stumbled upon <em>PostSecret,</em> I spent hours scrolling through people’s secrets. I completely understood the attraction of a blog about secrets—we all like to read other people’s confessions. But why would anyone submit them?</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Then I sent Warren my own secret postcard. And it all made sense. Secrets are about releasing a vulnerability. When we share them—even with strangers—we get relief. We feel less alone.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Every day, we make a decision about what to reveal and what to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_231" title="231"/>conceal about who we are,” explained Warren. “Those decisions affect what we talk about, who we talk to—and can weigh us down.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">A few years into <em>PostSecret</em>, Warren created an in-person event where he asked audience members to share secrets—live. “I was worried that it would be a total fail. That the anonymity of the blog is what gave the secrets power,” said Warren. But he didn’t need to worry.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">At one university event, a professor came up to the microphone and admitted, “I have been stoned for every single lecture this semester.” The shocked crowd embraced her. “The audience is on an emotional roller coaster, too. Everyone is incredibly supportive. Sometimes we can’t support the secret, but we can support the courage of sharing it,” explained Warren.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The live events draw hundreds and sometimes thousands of people to share and hear confessions. “People bond incredibly fast at these events. It’s as if secrets are the door to connection people have been looking for,” said Warren. When he signs books, he often notices people in line forming friendships and collecting each other’s contact information. The secrets act as a catalyst for turning strangers into fast friends.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He has tapped into something I call the vulnerability effect. “Sharing our most vulnerable stories is a courageous act that channels intimacy with others and builds lasting relationships,” said Warren.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Revealing, as opposed to concealing, not only brings us relief, it also brings relief to the people who we reveal to. “People often find that when they let their secret go, they hadn’t been keeping it to begin with. Their secret had actually been keeping them,” said Warren. As humans, we can’t help but feel bogged down by what we perceive as our limitations and failings. So we try to hide them. We hold back from connecting with people for fear that they might see our ugly parts and judge us. What we don’t realize is that<strong> our secrets don’t have to prevent connection—they can encourage it.</strong></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Warren is in a unique position to see the patterns in our most private worries. Want to know what secret Warren gets most frequently? “By far, the most common postcard we get is: I pee in the shower,” said Warren. “The second most common secret we get has to do with belonging. Someone trying to find a community, someone shunned from their community—it seems everyone is trying to find someone or a group where they don’t have to have any secrets at all,” said Warren.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber108" id="SuperscriptNumber108"><sup class="endnote">1</sup></a></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_232" title="232"/>Reading through thousands of submissions from unrelated strangers, Warren kept seeing the same narrative: We want to belong, and to be accepted for who we are. Here’s the funny thing: <strong>We are afraid that our secrets will cause people to not accept us. But oftentimes, sharing our secrets is the fastest way to find acceptance.</strong></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Now, before we go on, let me be very clear on something. The goal of this chapter is not to get you to confess your secrets to anyone who will listen. That would be both terrifying and weird. Instead, you don’t have to feel weighed down by secrets in your interactions. This hack will teach you to leverage your vulnerability to elevate your relationships.</p>
			<h3 class="x05-Head-A">SECRET SCIENCE</h3>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Think back to the last time you had a zit.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Did you venture out into the world praying no one would notice the volcano about to erupt on your chin? When talking to people, were you petrified that the only thing they would notice was the giant red bump on your face? Did you become convinced that everyone was talking about it?</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">We always feel our vulnerabilities are painfully obvious. That people are scrutinizing us at every turn. That our blemishes define us. I hate to break it to you, but no one really cares—and I mean that in the nicest way possible.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Our mistakes are not noticed nearly as much as we think. This cognitive bias is called the spotlight effect. In one study, researchers Thomas Gilovich and Victoria Medvec at Cornell University decided to humiliate students for the sake of science.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber109" id="SuperscriptNumber109"><sup class="endnote">2</sup></a></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">First, researchers asked students to put on a Barry Manilow T-shirt—chosen for its high level of potential embarrassment. Then they asked each student to estimate the percent of people who would notice their Manilow T-shirt in a crowded classroom. The students made fairly high guesses, thinking most other students would notice (and probably make fun of the Manilow shirt). And then finally, they asked the students to walk into a classroom and join fellow students taking a survey. The results? The T-shirt-wearing participants grossly overpredicted how many students would notice. The estimates were twice as high as the actual number.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The researchers concluded:</p>
			<p class="x06-Extract-1P"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_233" title="233"/>Most of us stand out in our own minds. Each of us is the center of our own universe. Because we are so focused on our own behavior, it can be difficult to arrive at an accurate assessment of how much—or how little—our behavior is noticed by others. Indeed, close inspection reveals frequent disparities between the way we view our performance (and think others will view it) and the way it is actually seen by others.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber110" id="SuperscriptNumber110"><sup class="endnote">3</sup></a></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The things we dread—tripping while walking down the street, making a social gaffe at a party, or misreading something in a classroom—are rarely picked up on. And if they are noticed, they are usually forgotten.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">This is great news! If you mess up or expose your vulnerability, most people won’t even notice. Now I know what you’re thinking: “But Vanessa, even though most people don’t notice, what about the few people who do?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">I’m so glad you asked!</p>
			<h3 class="x05-Head-A">VULNERABILITY IS ATTRACTIVE</h3>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Most people will not notice your flubs and failings. But what about the people who do?</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Researchers Elliot Aronson, Ben Willerman, and Joanne Floyd wanted to know what people really think about those who make mistakes. In their study, they asked participants to listen to a recording of a student explaining how well he did on a quiz. The student talked about his background and then modestly described his 90 percent score on the exam.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Here was the catch: One group of participants hears the student knock over a mug of coffee and ruin their clothes at the end of the recording. The other group hears no such spill. The researchers then asked both groups, “How likable was this student?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Can you guess what happened? The student who spilled his coffee was rated as far more likable and socially attractive than the non-spilling student.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber111" id="SuperscriptNumber111"><sup class="endnote">4</sup></a></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Why? Mistakes humanize us. We all make mistakes, and we like people who are like us. (Remember Hack #5: Thread Theory?) Having above-average people skills is not about being perfect. It’s not about never making a social blunder again. Rather, people who have great interpersonal intelligence leverage their vulnerability.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_234" title="234"/>If vulnerabilities were bad, <em>PostSecret</em> never would have turned into a phenomenon. Frank Warren wouldn’t be the author of five books and the founder of a secret empire.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">And let’s be real: <strong>Trying to be perfect is not only impossible, it’s boring. Trying too hard smells like desperation. And staying in hiding is exhausting.</strong></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Vulnerability is sexy—it shows we are relatable, honest, and real. That is attractive. And the science proves it: “A blunder tends to humanize him and, consequently, increases his attractiveness.”<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber112" id="SuperscriptNumber112"><sup class="endnote">5</sup></a></p>
			<p class="x06-Epigraph">Vulnerability sounds like truth and feels like courage.</p>
			<p class="x06-Epigraph-Source">—Brené Brown</p>
			<h3 class="x05-Head-A">HOW TO BE VULNERABLE</h3>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">I’m standing on tiptoes in a dark, stinky hallway. My high-heel-clad feet are killing me, and the wall I am leaning on is pulsing with the pop music blaring in the next room. I’m fifth in line for the tiny, crusty bathroom.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Amazingly, this dank little corridor is actually my temporary escape from sitting at the sticky high-top tables and yelling over the loud music to people I barely know. It’s my friend’s thirtieth birthday party and she wants to “party like a twenty-one-year-old.” In sum, I’m in my personal social hell.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">I’m searching my clutch for some Advil when a girl I recognize from our party stands in line behind me. “Ugh,” she moans, “Seriously? This line is going to take forever!”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Now, I have a choice. I could nod empathetically and carry on waiting, or I could be honest . . . and a little vulnerable. “Yeah, I’m not sure what’s worse—standing in line in these heels or sitting out there at those tables,” I say.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She looks at me, looks down at my heels, and then bursts out laughing. “At least you’re not also wearing Spanx. My feet are numb and I can’t take a deep breath,” she says.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Thank goodness! A fellow human. I counter, “But would you really want to take a deep breath in here? It smells like stale beer.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_235" title="235"/>“Very good point. I’m just dreaming of my couch and my bathrobe right now,” she says.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I think I might cry tears of joy when I get to go home, put on my slippers, and turn on Netflix,” I confess.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">By the time it’s my turn in line, we are exchanging info and promising to get brunch next weekend. Later that night, I realize none of this would have happened had I not taken a small risk. I was uncomfortable—physically and socially—and I was not the only one. All I had to do was reach out.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Living in truth and embracing vulnerability doesn’t mean walking up to strangers and saying, “Hi, my name is Vanessa and I’m a recovering awkward person.” Well . . . that works, too. But there are much subtler (and less scary) ways you can use the power of vulnerability in your life.</p>
			<h3 class="x05-Head-A">FAVOR ME?</h3>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">There’s a famous story about Benjamin Franklin—no, not the one involving lightning. This one is far less dramatic, but just as intriguing.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">In the 1700s, Franklin was an influential writer and politician. While working in the Pennsylvania state legislature, Franklin had to win over a particularly difficult politician who was not a fan of his policies. Franklin could follow the typical route and grovel for his favor . . . or he could try something different.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Franklin—a lover of books—knew that this politician owned a copy of a rare book in his large home library. Franklin wrote him a letter asking if he could borrow the book. He said yes. After a few days, Franklin returned the book with a note of thanks. In subsequent meetings, the politician was friendlier and more attentive than ever before. Franklin had stumbled upon an interesting phenomenon: When someone does a kindness for you, they are more likely to like you.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber113" id="SuperscriptNumber113"><sup class="endnote">6</sup></a> This is dubbed the <strong>Franklin effect</strong>.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Over a century later, Jon Jecker and David Landy wanted to confirm that the Franklin effect really works. In their experiment, they told participants they could win some money by completing a series of surveys. The “administrator” of these surveys was actually an actor tasked with treating the participants as rudely as possible while they completed tests. When finished, the participants received a small amount of cash.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_236" title="236"/>Now, here’s where it gets interesting. In trial one, the fake administrator follows the student out of the lab and asks for a favor. “Would you mind returning the cash? I’m funding the study with my own money, and we’re almost out of funding.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">In trial two, a fake “secretary” runs after the students and asks for the same favor.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">In trial three, the participants were able to keep their winnings and no one asked for a favor.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">A few days later, the researchers asked the participants in all three trials to rate the administrator on likability. Guess what? <strong>The first trial participants rated the administrator as the most likable.</strong><a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber114" id="SuperscriptNumber114"><sup class="endnote">7</sup></a></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Let’s think about this for a hot second: Imagine you are a student taking some surveys for extra money. The administrator of the survey is rude to you, telling you to hurry up and dismissing you abruptly. Then—after you have spent all this time completing the survey, the administrator has the gall to ask you to give back your winnings. Do you think you would rate him as likable? I don’t think so! But research shows that in reality, this would work.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The Franklin effect is counterintuitive—which is what makes it so powerful. And it is our next hack:</p>
			<p class="x06-Extract-A-First">HACK #12: The Franklin Effect</p>
			<p class="x06-Extract-A-Last">Don’t be afraid to ask for advice, share a vulnerability, or admit a weakness—they bond you to people.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">When the administrator asked for help and admitted a vulnerability, he became more human, more relatable.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber115" id="SuperscriptNumber115"><sup class="endnote">8</sup></a> How can we use the Franklin Effect hack authentically—without just asking for favors from everyone we meet? Three words: Ask for advice.</p>
			<h3 class="x05-Head-A">ASK FOR ADVICE</h3>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Asking for advice is one of the best ways to get along with people and build lasting relationships. Here’s why:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-First"><strong>Asking for advice softly admits a vulnerability.</strong> When you ask for advice, you are admitting a gap in knowledge or a need for help in an authentic, non-scary way.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted"><strong><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_237" title="237"/>Asking for advice gets people talking.</strong> Remember how much people like to talk about themselves? Rather than being a burden, you spark pleasure (Hack #3: Conversational Sparks) and have the opportunity to highlight someone’s strengths (Hack #4: Highlighter). Being asked for our opinion shows that someone values what we have to say.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Last"><strong>Asking for advice helps you solve someone’s matrix.</strong> When someone gives you advice, you learn so much about them. You get insight into their perspective (Hack #7: Speed-Read) and the things that matter most to them (Hack #9: Primary Value).</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Asking for advice doesn’t have to be a formal process. In fact, it is one of the simplest ways to stimulate fascinating conversation. Listen for anecdotes people tell about themselves, and then follow up by asking for advice in those areas. If an interviewer mentions loving to read, you can ask for recommendations. If a date says she grew up nearby, ask for hidden coffee spots. If someone mentions loving to cook, ask for any secret kitchen tips.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Or kick off a conversation by asking for advice. These conversation sparkers work nicely:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-First">Have any good restaurants you like?</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">I’m thinking about taking a vacation at the end of the year—have you been anywhere great recently?</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">I’m looking for a new book to read this summer—have anything you would recommend?</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">What do you think I should get my girlfriend for our anniversary?</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">I’m playing in a new fantasy football league—how do you think this season will end up?</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">I’m thinking about buying a new car—do you like yours?</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">My in-laws are coming for dinner—have any recipes you like?</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">I have to open my speech next week with a joke—got any good crowd-pleasers?</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">What do you think I should do for my birthday coming up?</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Seen any funny YouTube videos recently?</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Last">My college friend is coming to visit—have any ideas for must-see hidden spots to take him?</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_238" title="238"/>If you’re ever worried about running out of things to say in a conversation or meeting, you can switch to the topic of advice. Try these seamless transitions:</p>
			<ol>
				<li class="x07-List-Numbered-1-First" value="1">So, I would love your advice on something: ____</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Numbered-1">Hey, can I brainstorm some ideas with you about this new project I’m working on?</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Numbered-1-Last">Speaking of which, do you have any thoughts on how to fix/change/solve ____?</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">You will notice that these transitions make people perk up. Their eyebrows will raise, they’ll lean in, and they’ll say something like, “Oh really? Happy to help.” We love to be helpful and be asked for help—and hopefully, their advice will actually help you.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><strong>Remember:</strong> Never ask for advice you don’t actually need. Vulnerability is about honesty, it’s not a trick to be used without integrity.</p>
			<h3 class="x05-Head-A">LOOK FOR ADVICE OPPORTUNITIES</h3>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Never miss an advice opportunity. You get them more often than you might realize.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><strong>Don’t miss casual opportunities for favors.</strong> When I go to someone’s home, I always accept a glass of water when offered. People frequently tweet me cool links of studies about people—I almost always retweet them and thank them for the recommendation. Every few weeks, I go on LinkedIn and accept the extremely kind recommendations and endorsements people have given me. After speaking events, I regularly ask audience members or meeting planners to write testimonials if they enjoyed themselves.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">May I ask you for a favor? If you are enjoying this book, please write a review on Amazon. I would greatly, greatly appreciate it! Cute emojis encouraged. <span class="Wingdings"><img alt="" class="h1em" src="../image/9780399564505_EPUB-19_vector-1.jpg"/></span></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><strong>Don’t be afraid to ask for casual advice.</strong> You can ask for advice informally on e-mail or social media. I regularly post open questions on my social media to all my followers. Anything from: “Do you like this shirt?” to “Does anyone know any good graphic designers?” to “What’s the best way to cook eggplant?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_239" title="239"/>I also post polls on Twitter asking for advice and votes. Like this one:</p>
			<div class="w80c">
				<img alt="" class="w100" id="image_pageMap_239" src="../image/95_Regret_Tweet_rev.jpg"/>
			</div>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><strong>Don’t undervalue unsolicited advice. </strong>The Franklin Effect is not just about asking for advice. It’s also about taking advice, help, and support when it is offered to you. We tend to be defensive when someone offers unsolicited advice. However, this is actually an opportunity! This is an unsolicited opportunity to harness the power of the Franklin Effect.</p>
			<h3 class="x05-Head-A">BE GRATEFUL</h3>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">To double the power of the Franklin effect, thank someone when they’ve given you advice—and show them that you’re taking it seriously. You’ll make people feel validated, helpful, and included.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">My grandma taught me this. Grandma Dee loves to make her own clothes. One day she called me and left me a voice mail asking for my measurements, “From your neck to your toes and your shoulder to your wrist.” I had no idea what she was making me, but dutifully called her back with the measurements.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">A few weeks later, she showed up with matching muumuus made from her old living room curtains. “Don’t worry,” she assured me, “I made yours have a slit to the knee since you are younger than me.” Oh, and the best part? She had enough material for headbands.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">I gave her a hug and thanked her for it. She was pleased—after all, she had spent weeks sewing it. I realized that it would make her way happier if I actually wore it. So I put it on and wore it for the rest of the day. As I am sure you can imagine, my grandma was ecstatic. She insisted on taking pictures and talked about it for weeks with her friends.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Now I try to pull out the muumuu whenever I see her—or at least wear the headband.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Don’t be afraid to get creative with your gratitude! I send people <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_240" title="240"/>gratitude journals with the first page filled in with the ways I’m thankful for them. I regularly mail people three-leaf-clover seed packets for thanks and good luck. When I ask for testimonials, I put them on my website, take a screenshot, and send it to the person with a thank-you note. When family friends gave my husband and me advice on where to go in Italy for our honeymoon, we followed it, took pictures, and sent them a mini-album with a thank-you card from Italy.</p>
			<div class="w80c">
				<img alt="" class="w100" id="image_pageMap_240" src="../image/96_Grandma_Muu_Muu_Image.jpg"/>
			</div>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Don’t underestimate the basics, either: Always send a thank-you card.</p>
			<h3 class="x05-Head-A">BONUS: ANTI-PERFECT</h3>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Perfection is a strange beast. We strive to be perfect so others will like us but don’t like people who try too hard to be perfect. The pursuit of perfection not only makes it nearly impossible to connect with people, it also makes us unattractive. Want to connect with people more quickly? Try to embrace these vulnerability cures:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-First"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_241" title="241"/>Admit when you’re wrong</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Don’t pretend to know a band you’ve actually never heard of</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Ask for forgiveness</li>

			<p class="x04-Body-Text">While standing in line at that awful nightclub, I opened a conversation with an honest admission and gained a friend. When I started writing this book, I began with a vulnerable confession. And I hope I gained you, as a reader.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">I can tie my greatest personal and professional achievements to single moments of vulnerability. For example, at a conference I once admitted to the woman sitting next to me that I had no idea what a speaker was talking about. She heartily agreed and we bonded while reminiscing about speaker horror stories. Later in the conversation, I found out she happened to be the head producer at CNN—a few months later, she created a segment for me to present my research on air and in columns.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><strong>In fact, when I share a confession or embarrassing story in my articles, more people read it, comment on it, and share it. </strong>It’s almost as if my admission of weakness makes people comfortable with their own weaknesses—and then they’re more likely to accept help. Luckily, I am always happy to sacrifice my dignity for the sake of my readers.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><strong>Special Note:</strong> Some people suck. Yes, there will be people who won’t welcome your vulnerability. And yes, you might even get people who try to use your weaknesses against you. But you know what? I think that is worth the risk. The way people respond to your honesty instantly shows you whether they are the kind of person you want to have in your life.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">If someone unsubscribes from my e-mail because they are offended at my lack of social grace, then they are not going to benefit from my tips.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">If that girl in the nightclub had rolled her eyes at my remark, I would have turned right around and kept looking for an Advil.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">If a reader picked up this book and couldn’t identify with awkward people, then this book wasn’t for them.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><strong>Bottom Line:</strong> We all have weaknesses. The right people will like you for them.</p>

			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">When I try to sing, I sound like a cat slowly dying of hypothermia. (No animals were harmed in the creation of this metaphor.)</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">So when I found out karaoke was the theme of my best friend’s rehearsal dinner, and I would have to participate as her “Babe of Honor,” I started Googling “easiest karaoke songs,” practicing in the shower, and generally freaking out.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The big night came. At the karaoke machine, I turned to my husband, frantic. “They don’t have my songs!” I whispered.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Ever calm, ever low neurotic, my husband said, “Don’t worry! You can do mine with me.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Guess what he picked? “The Real Slim Shady” by Eminem. Have you ever tried to karaoke rap music? Well, let me tell you, it is <em>hard.</em> Like, get-tripped-up-on-your-tongue, spit-on-the-audience, and look-at-the-screen-blankly hard.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">About two stanzas in, I was lost and feeling pretty humiliated, when an older woman sitting next to the stage leaned over and said something that has stuck with me, “Don’t worry about being the best singer, <strong>just commit.</strong> It’s not about the singing.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Somehow, this wiped the deer-in-the-headlights expression off my face. I pumped my hands up in the air and led the crowd in an impromptu wave. I threw out a couple of what <em>I</em> believed were hard-core hand gestures. Then I tried to breakdance.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The crowd loved it. They laughed at my lame attempts at the worm, cheered when I dropped it like it’s hot, and enthusiastically demanded more waves. My “mistakes” were wildly entertaining. Why? I committed to them.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">If you will humor me for a moment: I believe this is a metaphor for life. Karaoke is not about the singing, it’s about making a song your own. <strong>Life is not about being perfect, it’s about living it your way.</strong></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">As Frank Warren likes to say, “Free your secrets and become who you are.”</p>

			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Impressing people with fake flawlessness is both impossible and exhausting. Vulnerability is what truly elevates relationships.</p>

				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-First">People don’t notice your perceived weaknesses as much as you think.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Even if they do, your vulnerabilities are connection points.</li>

			<h2 class="x03-Chapter-Title">PROTECT</h2>
			<h2 class="x03-Chapter-Subtitle">How to deal with difficult people</h2>
			<p class="x03-CO-Body-Text"><span class="_idGenDropcap-1">I</span>’ve been screamed at, hung up on, and blown up at more times than I can count,” said Xochitl Gonzalez, “but that’s part of the job . . . and I love it.”  Gonzalez organizes some of the most unique, memorable, and incredible weddings around the world, and she will be the first to tell you that she is as much an impromptu family counselor as a wedding planner. In fact, there is no better person than Gonzalez to teach us how to deal with difficult people. Why? The combination of new love, huge budgets, complicated family ties, and unexpected expenditures can make hers one of the toughest interpersonal jobs in the world.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">After thousands of weddings, Gonzalez has discovered her own set of people patterns. And her observations are fascinating. A bride with low self-esteem usually has a helicopter mom. An assertive father typically has a daughter who marries a timid husband—“Perhaps because she already has a dominant male figure in her life?” Gonzalez guesses. Very meek grooms typically have either an opinionated fiancée or mother—if it’s both, Gonzalez knows it’s going to be a tough wedding.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I’ll never forget one bride who became obsessed with the party favors. When the luxury box of chocolates she had finally chosen didn’t turn out the way she had hoped, she became extremely upset,” explained Gonzalez. The bride screamed at the caterers and became strangely fixated on ribbons.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Gonzalez suspected something more was going on. She knew that in the midst of planning a wedding, the bride would be adopting her fiancé’s children, quitting her job, and moving to the suburbs to be a full-time <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_245" title="245"/>mom. “She had A LOT going on. I knew the favors were just symbolic of something else. So, I called her and said, ‘Is this really about the chocolates?’”<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber116" id="SuperscriptNumber116"><sup class="endnote">1</sup></a></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Gonzalez was right. The chocolates were only a trigger for the bride’s feelings that her life was spinning out of control. Luckily, Gonzalez was able to get to the root cause of the emotion. She encouraged the bride to have a much-needed conversation with her soon-to-be-husband and prevented a difficult situation from exploding into an impossible one.</p>
			<h3 class="x05-Head-A">SOCIAL FEAR</h3>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Gonzalez has two rules for dealing with difficult people:</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">First, <strong>prevent good people from becoming difficult</strong>.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Second, <strong>stop difficult people from being impossible</strong>.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">In both cases, the behavior stems from one thing: fear. When a bride freaks out over a dress or a mother-in-law blows up at a caterer, it’s usually not about the dress or the food. It’s simply fear coming out as something else—fear about not pleasing people, fear about money, or even fear about the marriage. When we are afraid, our worst selves rear their ugly heads.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">In social situations, fears can become even more aggravated. When we are around others, we fear:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-First">Being judged</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Not being liked</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Not meeting anyone we like</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Being rejected</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Being left out</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Being laughed at</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Saying something and having nobody laugh</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Being criticized</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Being perceived as boring</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Being weird</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Being out of control</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Being misunderstood</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Being forgotten</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Last">Being different</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_246" title="246"/>Which of these items resonates most for you? <strong>When you interact with people, what are you afraid of? </strong>These are your gremlins.</p>
			<p class="x06-Extract-1P"><strong>Gremlin</strong>: <em>n. </em>An imaginary, mischievous sprite regarded as responsible for an unexplained problem or fault.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Our gremlins give us social anxiety, make us awkward, and muddle up our charisma. They’re also largely invisible to us. We very rarely say, “I’m in a bad mood because I’m afraid of being rejected.” Or “I yelled at you because I am terrified of being criticized myself.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">I like to say that fear is a cross-dresser. It likes to wear different outfits. Sometimes fear can cause us to:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-First">Be people pleasers</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Be bossy</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Be defensive</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Be gossipy</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Be avoidant</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Be mean</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Be awkward</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Be boring</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Be critical</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Be narcissistic</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Go into denial</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Be needy</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Seek compliments</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Be selfish</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Last">Be dramatic</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Looking at this list, which sounds most like your reaction to fear? <strong>How does your fear dress up?</strong></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">We each have a gremlin that causes us to be difficult on our worst days. I can tell you my biggest gremlins are being excluded, feeling weird, and being different. My gremlins pop up anytime, anywhere for a host of different reasons. When I’m extremely nervous, I still get hives on my arms and legs. So I have to constantly check for them in awkward social situations and spend most of the time praying I won’t have a breakout. I <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_247" title="247"/>don’t like the taste of alcohol, so I’m always nervous about being the party pooper and unfun invitee—and often volunteer as sober driver. I have a really hard time hearing in loud rooms and almost always end up being the last to arrive and first to leave.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Mostly, I’m terrified that who I am will turn people off. My fear dresses up as awkwardness. When I’m in a survive situation, I clam up, make terrible, offensive jokes, and can’t stop talking. No really, I don’t shut up. Guess what happens next? Yup, exactly what I feared most. People think I’m weird and different. And then exclude me. In a crazy way, our fear makes our gremlins come true.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">I have found that our gremlins make us act in quite predictably difficult ways. They fall into these four categories:</p>

			<p class="x04-Body-Text">All of us tend to fall into one of these categories on our worst days. <strong>Be honest: which sounds most like you in your bad moments?</strong></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Don’t worry! You are not alone and it is <em>not</em> your fault. There’s a neurological explanation for why you feel this way.</p>
			<h3 class="x05-Head-A"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_248" title="248"/>THE SCIENCE OF FEAR</h3>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Joseph LeDoux, a New York University psychologist and neuroscientist, studies what he calls fear learning: the way our brains learn to detect and respond to external threats.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber117" id="SuperscriptNumber117"><sup class="endnote">2</sup></a></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">You might not be surprised to learn that fear is processed in the amygdala (remember, this is also where we process pleasure and produce dopamine). LeDoux  found that the amygdala’s fear responses can travel by not one but two pathways: the fast “low road” between the thalamus and the amygdala, and the slower “high road,” which begins at the thalamus but takes a detour to the neocortex before reaching the amygdala.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber118" id="SuperscriptNumber118"><sup class="endnote">3</sup></a></p>
			<p class="x07-List-Unnumbered-First"><strong>Low Road:</strong> This is the fast, automatic, primary fear response that helps us <em>react </em>quickly to a threat. The low road helps us survive.</p>
			<p class="x07-List-Unnumbered-Last"><strong>High Road:</strong> This is a slower, more logical secondary fear response that helps us <em>think</em> through a threat. The high road helps us thrive.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Let’s say you’re driving down the street and an accident happens right in front of you.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Immediately, your Low Road kicks in—within 12 milliseconds. You hit the brake, your blood starts pumping, you suck in a breath of air, and your eyes go wide so you can take in more of the scene.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">About 30 to 40 milliseconds later, your High Road jumps in. It processes what you just saw—should you call 911? Do you need to help the drivers? Should you pull over?</p>
			<div class="w80c">
				<img alt="" class="w100" id="image_pageMap_248" src="../image/98_Accident_graphic.jpg"/>
			</div>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_249" title="249"/>This fear processing system works great—most of the time. The problem is, the Low Road and the High Road have two slightly different goals.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Our Low Road wants us to be safe, protected, and secure. It wants us to survive without bodily harm.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Our High Road wants us to make good decisions that help us thrive. It wants us to have connections, reproduce, and be happy.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Sometimes these goals are aligned, and sometimes they aren’t. “The two paths do not always reach the same conclusions,” explained LeDoux.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber119" id="SuperscriptNumber119"><sup class="endnote">4</sup></a> For example, if you are afraid of rejection, your Low Road can kick into threat response mode. The moment you enter into a difficult interaction, you get sweaty palms, feel flushed, and have the desire to take flight. This Low Road response makes it impossible to be witty, build connections, or have a relaxed conversation.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Psychologist Dr. Daniel Goleman calls this emotional hijacking.</p>
			<p class="x06-Extract-1P"><strong>Emotional Hijacking</strong>: When your Low Road is in an emotional fear response, you cannot connect with your High Road, make logical decisions, or act in your best social interest.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He believes emotional hijacking is the reason social situations can be difficult—and why difficult people can be difficult.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><strong>Your gremlins are not just distracting; they force you into survival mode</strong>. Have you ever tried to have an intelligent conversation when you have dry mouth from nerves? Ever tried to be funny when you felt awkward? It’s almost impossible. This is because your apelike Low Road is slowing down your clever High Road.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Emotional systems tend to monopolize brain resources. It’s much easier for an emotion to control a thought than for a thought to control an emotion,” explained LeDoux.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber120" id="SuperscriptNumber120"><sup class="endnote">5</sup></a></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Triggers from your past can also condition you to react fearfully to relatively minor events. Let’s say your crush laughed in your face when you asked her to dance at your eighth-grade prom. You remember blushing uncontrollably as her friends giggled and pointed at you. You began to sweat and couldn’t breathe deeply (Low Road). You had no idea what to do, so you ran out of the room and hid in the bathroom. You decided to wait there until the dance was over (High Road).</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">As an adult, every time you enter a dark club with loud music and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_250" title="250"/>approach a woman to dance, your Low Road kicks in. It recognizes this scenario—and the time it didn’t go so well. So you begin to sweat, blush, and hyperventilate before you even talk to the girl. Your Low Road is telling you: “Run!” “Hide in the bathroom!” “Don’t talk to her!” Even though your High Road is telling you to approach the girl, and it has been a long time since your eighth-grade dance, your Low Road is <strong>emotionally hijacking you.</strong></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">This is why, in the Social Game Plan hack, you narrowed down your survive and thrive places. It’s impossible for you to implement people hacks when you’re in Low Road, survival mode. I want to get you into situations where your Low Road can stay quiet to allow your High Road to take over and be your awesome self. Difficult people don’t do this well.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">I don’t believe difficult people are bad people. I believe they are being emotionally hijacked the majority of the time. Their fear puts them in constant survival mode. And their gremlins make it impossible for them to compassionately connect or rationally compromise.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“We know that lots of people have fears that they can’t come to conscious terms with,” said LeDoux.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber121" id="SuperscriptNumber121"><sup class="endnote">6</sup></a> Our emotions are fully capable of overriding reason. The question is: How can we help difficult people overcome their fear and be more socially smart?</p>
			<h3 class="x05-Head-A">THE NUT JOB</h3>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Sometimes nutty people drive me bat-poop crazy. When someone’s gremlins are too much for me to deal with, I use a simple technique that I call:</p>
			<p class="x06-Extract-A-First">HACK #13: The NUT Job</p>
			<p class="x06-Extract-A-Last">When dealing with difficult people, <strong>n</strong>ame the emotion, <strong>u</strong>nderstand the feeling, and transform the fear.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><strong>The NUT Job both prevents crazy and calms crazy.</strong></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">This powerful little hack is a simplified version of a hostage release technique taught by Dr. Mark Goulston<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber122" id="SuperscriptNumber122"><sup class="endnote">7</sup></a>—yes, dealing with a difficult person can be like negotiating with a kidnapper. Let’s put on our big-boy pants.</p>
			<h4 class="x05-Head-B">Step #1: Name</h4>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Most gremlins are a product of not being recognized, accepted, or heard. You can quiet these fears by showing someone that you do recognize, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_251" title="251"/>accept, and hear exactly where they are coming from. This is done by the first stage of the NUT Job: naming.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">In naming, you are trying to find the answer to:</p>
			<p class="x06-Extract-A-1P">What is this person afraid of?</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The moment you identify the emotion someone is feeling, you open a release valve for their anxiety. Sound easy? It is simple, but for some reason it feels counterintuitive to most of us. <strong>Typically, when someone is emotional and we are not, we try to counterbalance them by staying calm. But this doesn’t work</strong>. In fact, it usually only infuriates an upset person even more.</p>

			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Based on her answers, it sounds like her primary value is Information or Status. Say the man asks more questions and narrows it down to Information. This is key information! Wanting a promotion right away is one thing. But merely wanting to know if you’re <em>deserving</em> of a promotion, and whether there is a timeline in place, is a very different goal. Here’s where the next step of the NUT Job comes in: Transform.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">My favorite phrases for understanding:</p>

			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Once someone is fully in High Road—their fears are disengaged and they’ve worked through the problem out loud—you can begin to transform the problem into a solution.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Note: Do NOT try to move onto the Transform step until you are fully done naming and understanding. If someone is still speaking in a loud voice, tearful or flushed with emotion—they are not done processing yet.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Once someone gives a big sigh of relief, begins to talk at a normal <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_255" title="255"/>level, and sounds more like themselves, then you can move on. In the Transform stage, you have two options: speed-read or use their appreciation language. If you can offer answers or facilitate a resolution—even better!</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Sometimes, as with many problems, they cannot fully be “fixed.” In that case, you are best going into appreciation language mode. You can at least value the person and make them feel less alone.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">During this stage, you’re answering the question:</p>

			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The NUT Job system is not about trying to change people—which usually only makes them double down on their bad behavior—but about valuing them and providing deeper understanding of a problem. <strong>You can’t argue with a feeling, but you can acknowledge it.</strong></p>

				<div class="Fast-Fact">
					<p class="x09-Box-Title">FAST FACT BOX</p>

			<h3 class="x05-Head-A">BONUS: HOW TO SAY NO</h3>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Toxic people constantly throw you into Low Road survival mode. They push boundaries, challenge your worth, and can even turn thrive situations into survive ones by waking up your gremlins. <strong>Toxic people are not worth your energy.</strong></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">However, many of us have Low Road fears about saying no. We say yes <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_257" title="257"/>out of habit, or because it’s scary to set up boundaries. Or—let’s be real—we feel we don’t deserve to stand up for ourselves.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">It’s time to give yourself permission to say no to the toxic people who drain you. You deserve to interact on your terms, with people you like. <strong>When you say no to the wrong relationships, you make room to say yes to the right ones. </strong>Here’s how to say no:</p>
			<h4 class="x05-Head-B">Step #1: Eat Humble Pie</h4>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Saying no doesn’t mean you should be ungrateful. You can set boundaries and say no without offending anyone.</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-First">“Thank you so much for asking.”</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">“How wonderful of you to offer.”</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">“This is a lovely idea.”</li>
			</ul>
			<h4 class="x05-Head-B">Step #2: No Hemming and Hawing</h4>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Don’t beat around the bush. If you hesitate or waver, toxic people will sense weakness and try to change your mind. Be clear and concise.</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-First">“I’m so sorry I won’t be able to join.”</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">“I won’t be able to get together.”</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">“I can’t come.”</li>
			</ul>
			<h4 class="x05-Head-B">Step #3: No Excuses</h4>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">This is the most important step! You don’t have to defend, debate, or explain your feelings. That’s right, you don’t need to give a reason. In fact, when you do offer an explanation (even when it’s legitimate), it just ends up sounding like an excuse. Offering a why also gives toxic people room to argue with you—and oh, they will. Toxic people do not like when boundaries are placed on them.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Here’s what happens when you try to offer toxic people a reason (real or not):</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-First"><strong>Toxic Person:</strong> “You have another party? No worries, just pop over for a little!”</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted"><strong>Toxic Person:</strong> “You’re busy? I’m busy, too—this will only be twenty minutes, you have to get coffee at some point, right? I’ll just meet you for a little catch-up.”</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Last"><strong><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_258" title="258"/>Toxic Person:</strong> “Don’t worry about being tired. You’ll get energized with all the drinks!”</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><strong>Special Note:</strong> If you have trouble doing this in person, you can always ask for time to think about an invite. Say you have to check your calendar and you’ll get back to them in a few days. You can also e-mail or text a response so you can choose your words carefully—sometimes hard to do when face-to-face. You’ll get more comfortable with practice.</p>
			<h4 class="x05-Head-B">Optional Step: Step It Up</h4>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">If you get an invitation you’re not crazy about, sometimes you can make a counteroffer. For example, a friend of mine invited me to her birthday at a pool hall. I knew it would not be my scene, nor a good way to catch up with her. I offered to take her to brunch that morning instead, which worked out better for both of us because we got to really talk. You could say:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-First">“I can’t do dinner, but let’s grab a coffee instead.”</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">“A meeting won’t work, but let’s hop on the phone.”</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Last">“Sorry I can’t make the party; can I take you out to brunch tomorrow?”</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">I know it’s hard to say no. But this sets you up for growth.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Sometimes farmers have to burn their fields in order to make way for a healthy crop. Fire is a natural part of the ecological cycle. The old crop’s residue and weeds must go. They call this process a controlled burn.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><strong>Do you need to start your own controlled burn?</strong> Clearing out the weeds makes room for new growth.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">For Xochitl Gonzalez, learning to say no was one of the most difficult parts of her professional growth. “You want to help everyone. But not everyone can be helped,” said Gonzalez. “This job taught me how <em>not</em> to be a people pleaser. I don’t hold myself to other people’s compliments or requirements. I have my own standards for excellence and I hold my ground. If I suspect someone can’t handle that, I don’t work with them.”<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber123" id="SuperscriptNumber123"><sup class="endnote">8</sup></a></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">You cast the people who you want to play a role in your life. Choose wisely.</p>
			<h3 class="x05-Head-A"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_259" title="259"/>CHALLENGES</h3>
			<ol>
				<li class="x07-List-Numbered-1-First-No-Space" value="1">Think about the five most important people in your life. What are their gremlins?</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Numbered-1">Take a hard look at yourself: What are your gremlins? How do they dress up?</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Numbered-1"><strong>Bonus:</strong> Do you have a toxic person you need to slowly release from your life?</li>
			</ol>
			<h3 class="x05-Head-A">CHAPTER REVIEW</h3>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Everyone has social fears. When you address someone’s fear by seeking to understand it, you can transform a problem into a solution. This approach can make you an ally of the most difficult people.</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-First">Know how your social fears dress up.</li>

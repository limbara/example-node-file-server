			<h2 class="x03-Chapter-Number"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_86" title="86"/>CHAPTER 5</h2>
			<h2 class="x03-Chapter-Title">INTRIGUE</h2>
			<h2 class="x03-Chapter-Subtitle">How to be ridiculously likable</h2>
			<p class="x03-CO-Body-Text"><span class="_idGenDropcap-1">I</span>n 2007, Lewis Howes was at the top of his game. As a six-foot-four wide receiver for the Arena Football League and an All-American decathlete, Howes was poised to go all the way to the NFL.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Then he snapped his wrist on a diving catch, and his dream of professional football was over in a matter of seconds. “It wasn’t pretty. I was 24 years old, washed up, broke, and sleeping on my sister’s couch with my arm in a cast and a mountain of credit card debt staring me in the face,” said Howes.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber46" id="SuperscriptNumber46"><sup class="endnote">1</sup></a></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Howes had to start a new career track from scratch and accidentally discovered a powerful way to connect with people. In 2008, LinkedIn was a small social media website for business professionals, but Howes saw an opportunity to stay in touch with people in athletics—even though he could no longer play, he still had a passion for sports.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He began to construct his contact list from scratch. Next, he started testing what kind of messages worked best on cold contacts. “It was easy to track which messages were working and which were not based on the replies in my LinkedIn inbox,” explained Howes.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber47" id="SuperscriptNumber47"><sup class="endnote">2</sup></a> He found that his most successful messages mentioned at least three commonalities he had with the person.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I would try to find at least three things we shared—usually a mutual connection, a mutual interest, and a mutual organization, like a school, league, or sports team,” said Howes. These messages were short and to the point. Howes composed a sample for me using this method:</p>
			<p class="x06-Extract-1P"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_87" title="87"/>Hi Vanessa! My name is Lewis and I wanted to reach out because I saw you’re also friends with Nick Onken, we do work with Pencils of Promise together. I’m based in LA and saw you’re from here. Do you ever get back in town? Would love to connect.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Howes crafted a strategy for his follow-up messages, too. “I told them I loved their work and wanted to learn from them. I was direct and said, ‘My goal is to learn about you and your success,’” said Howes. He ended every interaction with a specific question they could answer.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Amazingly, this approach landed Howes phone calls, one-on-one meetings, and mentorships with some of the most powerful people in sports over and over again. One of his most impressive cold messages landed him a meeting with the cofounder of ESPN, Bill Rasmussen. “I was this kid with no job and no money, but I reached out to Bill and was able to get a sit-down meeting and interview him,” recalled Howes.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">After the first year of reaching out to important people and learning from them, Howes hit a turning point. He realized what he was doing wasn’t enough. “At this point, I understood that I couldn’t just take, I had to give. But how do you give to someone like Bill Rasmussen?” explained Howes.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">As his contact list grew, Howes realized he finally had something to offer his connections—his own network. “I enjoyed helping people and relished becoming what Malcolm Gladwell calls a ‘connector,’” said Howes.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber48" id="SuperscriptNumber48"><sup class="endnote">3</sup></a> He asked his VIPs who they wanted to meet and then worked to get them that connection.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I would ask people, ‘What’s your biggest challenge right now?’ and then would connect them with at least three people who I thought could help. I would literally take out my phone over our cups of coffee, make the call, and hand the person my phone,” said Howes.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Howes also applied the Triple Threat to all of his interactions without even realizing it—and it worked like a charm. “I show people I’m listening to them and only them. I make eye contact, take them in, and pay attention to nothing else,” said Howes.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">By January 2010, his company had over $5 million in sales. Eventually, he sold his business for seven figures. Now, Howes runs a successful lifestyle blog and podcast called <em>The School of Greatness</em>, where he interviews VIPs, experts, and luminaries on a wide variety of subjects. He uses his <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_88" title="88"/>connection skills to find the most interesting, remarkable, and fascinating people to interview—I should know, I was one of them! (Insert self-deprecating laugh here.) Yes, he did use the exact template above to reach out to me to be on his podcast.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">This chapter is about the powerful human behavior principle that makes Howes so socially attractive.</p>
			<h3 class="x05-Head-A">THE SIMILARITY-ATTRACTION EFFECT</h3>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">One night I was having dinner with a few friends when someone pulled a Pilot G-2 pen out of her purse to take some notes. My friend Tyler spotted it instantly and asked, “Does your G-2 pen have a point-seven-millimeter tip?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She didn’t even have to look. “Well, of course it does. Point-seven-millimeter tips are the only sensible choice for Pilot G-2s.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Tyler smiled knowingly. “We are going to be friends,” he said simply.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Now, I am no pen expert, but according to Tyler, the Pilot G-2 .7mm pen is simply the best. So good, in fact, that Tyler not only fiercely guards his against borrowing thieves, but also uses it as a sign. “If someone has a G-2 pen, I know we are going to get along,” Tyler explains.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">What’s going on here? As humans, we are constantly on the lookout for people who are similar to us. “Birds of a feather flock together” is a far more accurate cliché than “opposites attract.” This is called the <strong>similarity-attraction effect.</strong> It says that “people like and are attracted to others who are similar, rather than dissimilar, to themselves.”<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber49" id="SuperscriptNumber49"><sup class="endnote">4</sup></a></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Researchers Dr. Ellen Berscheid and Dr. Elaine Walster believe we enjoy spending time with people who are similar to us for combinations of the following reasons:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-First">It is easier to get along with someone who enjoys the same activities and conversation topics. Spouses and friends are more likely to have similar personality types than randomly assigned pairs.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">When someone agrees with us, it makes us feel less alone and more right in our own opinions.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">If we can relate to someone strongly, we might be able to better predict their behavior and future decisions, making us feel more in control.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Last"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_89" title="89"/>We hope that if someone is similar to us, then there is a greater likelihood they will be attracted to us—like begets like.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber50" id="SuperscriptNumber50"><sup class="endnote">5</sup></a></li>
			</ul>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">A “like” on Facebook or a “heart” on Instagram or a “retweet” on Twitter are all digital forms of the similarity-attraction effect in action. When you give someone some link love, you are telling them, “I like this, too!” That is why we are so addicted to checking our social media—we like to know that our friends and followers both like us and are like us.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Without realizing it, we are <strong>constantly searching for reasons to think, feel, or say, “Me too!”</strong> In a good meeting or great coffee date, you hear phrases like this:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-First">Wow—you like <em>Orange Is the New Black</em>? I’m an addict!</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">You’re gluten free? Join the club!</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Oh, I love Thailand! Maybe we were there at the same time?</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Are you kidding? I’m a huge 49ers fan.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Last">You’re into rock climbing? Me too!</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">On the other hand, one of the biggest mistakes I see people make is inadvertently pointing out differences while trying to connect. <strong>Whenever you say a version of “Not me!” you are handicapping your connection from the start.</strong> “Not me!” phrases sound like this:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-First">You know, I never really got into <em>Orange Is the New Black</em>. I thought it was kinda boring.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">You’re one of those gluten-free people? Don’t you think that’s a fad?</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">I’m not a big traveler.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Sports? No, thank you! I would rather read a book or watch the news.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Last">You’re into rock climbing? Not me! I’m afraid of heights.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">These kinds of “Not me!” comments tend to push people away and shut down a conversation. Does this mean you constantly have to blindly agree with people you meet? No, of course not! But it does mean you have to put effort into searching for real similarities and shared interests.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">When someone posts something on social media that isn’t relevant to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_90" title="90"/>you, you just keep scrolling. You don’t share the post with a huffy comment like “This isn’t relevant to me!” But we sometimes imply as much in our responses. So if someone mentions they went to private school growing up, don’t say, “Ugh! I hated those preppy kids. I went to good old public school.” Instead, note it and resume looking for something you do have in common. (You might say, “Interesting! Did you play any sports?” or “Wow, I didn’t know that, tell me more!”)</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><strong>Don’t fall into the “Not me!” trap; instead, find a way to say “Me too!”</strong></p>
			<h3 class="x05-Head-A">SEARCHING FOR “ME TOO”</h3>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">My friend Allon Freiman sells raffle tickets at sporting events for charity. He messaged me with an interesting question:</p>
			<p class="x06-Extract-First">Hey Vanessa! I was wondering if you could use your human behavior knowledge to help me out with something I have been wondering. When I sell raffle tickets at games I often dress in a suit to be more professional. But recently I have been thinking that I should dress in team colors—maybe my tie or something? Let me know if there is any science to this or if you think it is a good idea.</p>
			<p class="x06-Letter-Closing">Best, Allon</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Allon’s intuition was absolutely right. We like people who look like us. One study found that we are more likely to help people who are dressed like us.<a href="29_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber51" id="SuperscriptNumber51"><sup class="endnote">6</sup></a> Someone dressed casually is more likely to help someone else who is also dressed casually over someone in a business suit. This is counterintuitive—one would think that someone in a business suit would be helped more often, period. Not so.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">I advised Allon to not only wear the team’s colors but also to dress exactly like the fans he was trying to sell to—jeans, jersey, sneakers, hat and all. Guess what? He immediately began to sell more raffle tickets. This is the similarity-attraction effect in action.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">We don’t just have a soft spot for people who <em>look </em>like us, we are also drawn to people who <em>think</em> like us. There is an admittedly terrible (and addictive) MTV show that I watch “for work” to “observe human behavior.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><em>Are You the One?</em> is a reality show where ten men and ten women are <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_91" title="91"/>brought into a house to find their soul mate. But, of course, there’s a catch. Each of the contestants has taken a battery of personality tests with “love experts” who have picked one ideal mate for them. Their goal is to find their ideal match from the batch of singles.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">In season three, two of the singles, Connor Smith and Kayla Brackett, try to get a feel for their compatibility. Here’s how that conversation goes (note the constant searching for similarity):</p>
			<p class="x06-Dialogue-First"><span class="_6-Dialogue-Speaker">KAYLA:</span> I want someone who is close to their family.</p>
			<p class="x06-Dialogue"><span class="_6-Dialogue-Speaker">CONNOR:</span> I’m a total mama’s boy. But can you keep someone’s attention?</p>
			<p class="x06-Dialogue"><span class="_6-Dialogue-Speaker">KAYLA:</span> Are you kidding me, that is all me. I whip my man into shape. That’s my thing.</p>
			<p class="x06-Dialogue"><span class="_6-Dialogue-Speaker">CONNOR:</span> Huh, that’s what I ask for!</p>
			<p class="x06-Dialogue"><span class="_6-Dialogue-Speaker">KAYLA:</span> I want someone who is big and strong, because I like to feel protected. (Note: Connor is over six foot five and calls himself the Gentle Giant.)</p>
			<p class="x06-Dialogue"><span class="_6-Dialogue-Speaker">CONNOR:</span> I always want to sleep on the side of the bed closest to the door.</p>
			<p class="x06-Dialogue"><span class="_6-Dialogue-Speaker">KAYLA:</span> Oh good, I like to be closer to the wall!</p>
			<p class="x06-Dialogue-Last"><span class="_6-Dialogue-Speaker">SUMMARY:</span> You’re like me. I like what you like. I like you.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">We engage in the exact same behavior as Connor and Kayla even in nonromantic situations. We do it with potential clients—aligning interests and work methods. We do it with new friends—comparing music taste and weekend activities. We even do it in line with strangers—commiserating over the long wait.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">You can hack the similarity-attraction effect for your benefit with what I call:</p>
			<p class="x06-Extract-A-First">HACK #5: Thread Theory</p>
			<p class="x06-Extract-A-Last">Find and follow threads of similarity to be more socially attractive.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Every interaction should be about finding threads of commonalities. Every thread that binds you brings you closer to a person. The more threads you have, the more socially attractive you become. Here’s how you can use thread theory to connect with the people you meet instantly:</p>
			<h4 class="x05-Head-B"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_92" title="92"/>Step #1: Search for Threads</h4>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Thread Theory is the ultimate tool for opening any conversation. Whether you are cold-calling, e-mailing a new contact, or meeting someone for the first time, the Thread Theory can help you blast through the dialogue door.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Imagine that each person is walking around carrying a big knotted ball of string. All of these strings are their thoughts, ideas, and opinions. We often wish our thoughts were more organized, but they are usually in a jumble—especially when we first walk into an event. We might be thinking about our to-do list, our parking meter, what we want for dinner, that good-looking person across the room, our neck ache, where to hang our coat—you get the idea. So we are all walking around carrying this mass of thoughts.</p>
			<div class="w80c">
				<img alt="" class="w100" id="image_pageMap_92_0" src="../image/49_Two_Balls_of_String.jpg"/>
			</div>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The Thread Theory is an incredibly easy way to both open conversations and never run out of things to say. When you first begin in an interaction, I want you to try to tease out some thoughts you both share. The more threads you share, the more you will be able to talk about—and the more ridiculously likable you will be.</p>
			<div class="w80c">
				<img alt="" class="w100" id="image_pageMap_92_1" src="../image/50_One_common_thread.jpg"/>
			</div>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">There are three main categories of commonalities that you can pull from at any time:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-First"><strong>People:</strong> Mutual contacts are the best way to find threads of similarity. You can also liven up the conversation by searching for mutual friends.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted"><strong><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_93" title="93"/>Context:</strong> Think you don’t have anything in common? Think about the context of your meeting. Maybe you’re both on LinkedIn or both at the same conference. All you have to do is ask about it to get the conversational ball rolling.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Last"><strong>Interests:</strong> Common interests are the best kind of threads because they introduce a topic you both invariably know a lot about, ripe territory for great stories and interesting conversation.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Here are a few openers and ideas for tapping into each type of commonality:</p>

			<p class="x04-Body-Text">These Thread Theory questions can be used in groups, with new people and even in e-mails and cold messages. Every time you discover a common thread, it links you together:</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_94" title="94"/>You might have noticed that some of these Thread Theory questions are also my favorite conversation sparkers—that’s no coincidence! Simple questions can lead you into exciting conversational territory when you ask strategically and follow up with good listening.</p>
			<div class="w80c">
				<img alt="" class="w100" id="image_pageMap_94_0" src="../image/51_Example_threads_image.jpg"/>
			</div>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">If you ask one of these questions and don’t find a similarity, it’s totally okay. For example, if someone says, “Oh, I don’t know her,” or “Nope, never been here before.” No worries! Use that as an opener. You can say, “Yeah, it is a pretty big school. I think she studied political science. What did you study?” or “Me neither! Do you have any favorite local watering holes you go to?” Every answer you hear is one more step in getting to know them and being further along in conversation. <strong>Don’t let it faze you, let it fuel you</strong>.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Be on the lookout for physical examples of similarities, too. For example, if you notice someone’s USC keychain you can say, “Go Trojans!” Or if someone is driving a car you like, you can comment, “I was thinking about buying that car, how do you like it?” It can even be as simple as noticing what someone is drinking: “The red wine isn’t bad, huh?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Making conversation has never been so easy.</p>

			<h4 class="x05-Head-B"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_95" title="95"/>Step #2: Follow the Thread</h4>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">The Thread Theory is not about simply pointing out similarities; it is about exploring them. Once you have found a common thread, you can make it stronger by following it.</p>
			<div class="w80c">
				<img alt="" class="w100" id="image_pageMap_95" src="../image/53_People_Context_Interests.jpg"/>
			</div>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">How do you follow a common thread? Easy. Ask for why.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Revolutionary Japanese inventor Sakichi Toyoda founded Toyota Motor Company in 1937. He is also known for his innovative managerial techniques, one of which is called the Five Whys.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Toyota employees use the Five Whys to problem solve and get to the bottom of issues. This technique is now used across industries to quickly and effectively find solutions and root causes of problems. You might use the Five Whys to figure out why a colleague is late on a project:</p>
			<ol>
				<li class="x07-List-Numbered-1-First" value="1">Why? I couldn’t get the numbers on time.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Numbered-1">Why? I didn’t know the right person to talk to.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Numbered-1">Why? I have never worked with that department before.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Numbered-1">Why? I usually go through my manager.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Numbered-1-Last">Why? Interdepartmental communications only go through managers, which causes a bottleneck. (Root cause)</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Of course, in day-to-day conversations you can’t ask why over and over again, but <strong>you can get a conversation to go much deeper much faster if you use the spirit of the Five Whys.</strong></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">When you find a commonality, don’t let it pass by, ask the other person why it’s important to them. When you stumble upon a similarity, don’t jump to the next topic; take it a step further and find out how they got started. If you hear a shared interest, don’t let it hang without comment; dig a little deeper.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Let’s say, through the Thread Theory, you find out the person you are <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_96" title="96"/>speaking with is also an entrepreneur. If you follow that thread, you get a much deeper interaction:</p>
			<p class="x06-Dialogue-First"><span class="_6-Dialogue-Speaker">YOU:</span> <strong>Why </strong>did you decide to become an entrepreneur?</p>
			<p class="x06-Dialogue"><span class="_6-Dialogue-Speaker">THEM:</span> I always wanted to start my own business.</p>
			<p class="x06-Dialogue"><span class="_6-Dialogue-Speaker">YOU:</span> Interesting! <strong>Why </strong>did that appeal to you?</p>
			<p class="x06-Dialogue"><span class="_6-Dialogue-Speaker">THEM:</span> I really wanted flexibility and freedom in work hours, and I knew I could never get that with a boss.</p>
			<p class="x06-Dialogue"><span class="_6-Dialogue-Speaker">YOU:</span> I feel the same way! <strong>Why</strong> were you looking for more flexibility?</p>
			<p class="x06-Dialogue"><span class="_6-Dialogue-Speaker">THEM:</span> Oh, I love to travel so I wanted to be able to work from anywhere.</p>
			<p class="x06-Dialogue"><span class="_6-Dialogue-Speaker">YOU:</span> That’s wonderful—I’m also a huge traveler, I just came back from Chile! <strong>Why</strong> do you love to travel?</p>
			<p class="x06-Dialogue"><span class="_6-Dialogue-Speaker">THEM:</span> I have been dying to go to Chile! You know, I think I love travel so much because I think it’s so important to get out of your comfort zone and learn from people around the world.</p>
			<p class="x06-Dialogue"><span class="_6-Dialogue-Speaker">YOU:</span> That’s so true! I have met the most interesting people on my travels. <strong>Why</strong> do you think being out of our comfort zone is so important?</p>
			<p class="x06-Dialogue-Last"><span class="_6-Dialogue-Speaker">THEM:</span> Hmmm, good question. I guess I think true happiness comes from trying new things, seeing new things, experiencing new things. How about you? Where do you think happiness comes from?</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">This is a synthesized version of the kind of robust, deep conversations that come when you ask more whys. “Why” gets you beyond small talk into an exploration of motivations, dreams, and interests. And every why helps you find more threads.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><strong>In this way, the Thread Theory ensures you will never run out of things to talk about.</strong> Nor will you ever have to be worried that you won’t have something to say. Just search for the commonality and follow the thread with why.</p>

					<p class="x09-Box-Text-Last">We had 1,049 participants tell us who they have the hardest time communicating with. As you can see, we all have someone we have a hard time communicating with and the results are all over the board! You can use the Thread Theory with anyone in your life to make communication easier. Who is your person? How can you find a tie with them?</p>

			<h4 class="x05-Head-B">Step #3: Create Ties</h4>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">The last step of the Thread Theory is optional and reserved only for special interactions. When you are having a really great discussion and clicking with someone, you can take your connection to the next level by using your common threads to tie you together. Let’s look at how Lewis Howes did this.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">After he searched for commonalities and followed the threads he found, he asked people what they needed and how he could help. In other words,<strong> he tied his abilities to their needs</strong>. When you say, “You have a problem, I’m going to help you fix it,” you create the ultimate similarity.</p>
			<div class="w80c">
				<img alt="" class="w100" id="image_pageMap_98" src="../image/55_Problem_Solution.jpg"/>
			</div>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><strong><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_98" title="98"/>Every time you offer help, support, and advice, you create a deeper bond with someone and a permanent similarity.</strong></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Most of the time, opportunities to help people find solutions come up organically. You hear someone has a need and know you can help. Here are some examples:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-First">Since you’re new in town, I can send you a list of my favorite local restaurants.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">I’m sure I know someone in that industry—connect with me on LinkedIn and I can introduce you.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">I frequently get extra tickets to the game; I’ll text you next time!</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">It sounds like that is a real problem. Let’s set up a consult call and I can see if my company can help.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Last">Yeah, going vegan is so hard. I have a few recipes I can send you.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">If nothing comes up during a conversation, you can also end with a tie. I typically end most of my great meetings with a single question:</p>
			<p class="x06-Extract-1P">Can I help you with anything?</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">This is my favorite Thread Theory question<strong>. </strong>Not only does it give me a chance to create a tie, but also I usually end up learning something new about them. It’s a tiny hack that goes a long way.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">In fact, every step of Thread Theory is others oriented in that it helps people untangle their own bundles of thoughts. For example, going through the Five Whys with a friend can help them figure out why things aren’t working at their job. Following a thread with a partner could help you both figure out vacation plans.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><strong>Remember:</strong> Since step three of the Thread Theory is optional, you actually have to mean it when you use it. Don’t offer help you can’t give. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_99" title="99"/>Don’t make hollow promises. Create ties only with people who you genuinely want to be connected to.</p>
			<h5 class="x05-Head-C">Bonus: Teach Me?</h5>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">What if you can’t find a thread? What if there are no authentic opportunities for “Me too”?</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Lewis Howes frequently interviews experts on his podcast in new areas of business or life, and when he can’t say “Me too,” he says, “Teach me.” This produces incredible content for his listeners <em>and</em> deep connections between him and his experts. If someone mentions something that you don’t know about or are unfamiliar with, ask for more information. “Teach me?” is still a thread!</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Here are some ways you can make “Teach me?” a thread:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-First">I have never heard of that book—what is it about?</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">What an interesting career—I have never met anyone in your line of work before. Tell me about it!</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Last">I’ve actually never been out of the country, but would love to travel more. Have any insider tips for a beginner?</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><strong>Bottom Line:</strong> “Me too!” and “Teach me?” are two of the most powerful and underutilized phrases we have. Use them whenever possible.</p>
			<h3 class="x05-Head-A">CHALLENGES</h3>
			<ol>
				<li class="x07-List-Numbered-1-First-No-Space" value="1">Next time you talk to someone, try finding three commonalities in the first three minutes.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Numbered-1">Practice asking “why?” five times and see if you learn something new.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Numbered-1">Create a tie by asking a colleague or friend if you can help them with anything.</li>
			</ol>
			<h3 class="x05-Head-A">CHAPTER REVIEW</h3>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">The more you have in common with someone, the more likable you become. We like people like us. The Thread Theory is an easy way to captivate attraction by simply searching for shared interests, asking why, and then offering to help. Always be on the lookout for ways to say, “Me too!”</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-First"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pageMap_100" title="100"/>Don’t overthink what you are going to say, just search for commonalities.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">Go deeper by asking the Five Whys.</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Last">Tie yourself to someone by making their problem your own.</li>
			</ul>
